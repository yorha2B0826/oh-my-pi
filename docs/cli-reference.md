# CLI reference

`omp` is invoked as:

```sh
omp [command] [flags] [messages...]
```

When the first non-flag argument is **not** a registered subcommand, `omp`
routes to the default [`launch`](#launch-the-default-command) command and treats
the arguments as the initial prompt. So `omp "fix the build"` launches a session
with that message, while `omp models` runs the `models` subcommand.

Runtime help is also available:

- `omp --help` lists user-facing subcommands and common launch flags.
- `omp <command> --help` prints that command's public flags and examples.

This page is the consolidated reference for the shared **launch surface** (the
flags accepted by `omp` / `omp launch`) and every top-level **subcommand**.
Per-subcommand flags (for example `omp auth-broker --json`) are documented by
each command's `--help`.

## Launch (the default command)

`omp` and `omp launch` start a coding session. Positional arguments become the
initial message(s):

```sh
# Interactive session
omp

# Interactive session with an initial prompt
omp "List all .ts files in src/"

# Attach files/images to the initial message (prefix with @)
omp @prompt.md @image.png "What color is the sky?"

# Non-interactive: process the prompt and exit (headless / print mode)
omp -p "List all .ts files in src/"

# Continue the previous session
omp --continue "What did we discuss?"
```

Argument handling:

- `@<path>` attaches a file or image to the initial message.
- Non-TTY stdin is read automatically as the initial prompt; do not add a `-`
  marker.
- `--` ends flag parsing; everything after it is literal message text, even if it
  looks like a flag.

### Launch flags

#### Session and workspace

| Flag | Description |

#### Model selection

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--model <id-or-role>` | Model or configured role to use (role: `slow` or `@slow`; fuzzy model match: `opus`, `gpt-5.2`, or `openai/gpt-5.2`). |

| `--provider-session-id <id>` | Reuse a specific provider-side session id for continuity and cache scoping. |
| `--prompt-cache-key <key>` | Override the provider prompt-cache key for this session. |
| `--service-tier <tier>` | OpenAI service tier for this session (`none` omits `service_tier`). |

See [providers](./providers.md) and [models](./models.md) for model resolution.

#### Thinking and reasoning

| Flag | Description |

| `--thinking <level>` | Set the thinking level: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, or `auto`. |

| `--print-thoughts` | Include thinking blocks in print-mode text output. |
| `--external-thinking` | Use a private scratchpad while disabling supported GPT/Claude/Gemini reasoning. Use at your own risk: providers have flagged this request shape as abuse. |

#### Prewalk and plan modes

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--prewalk` | Switch to a fast/cheap model at the first edit/write after the plan's todo list exists (default off; see `prewalk.enabled`). |
| `--no-prewalk` | Disable prewalk even if `prewalk.enabled` is set. |
| `--prewalk-into <id>` | Target model for prewalk (default the `smol` role). |
| `--plan-yolo` | Force read-only plan mode at start, auto-approve the plan on the model's first resolve call, then switch to `--plan-yolo-into` to implement it. |
| `--plan-yolo-into <id>` | Target model for plan-yolo execution (default the `smol` role). |

#### Tools, approvals, and runtime

| `--no-tools` | Disable all built-in tools. |
| `--no-lsp` | Disable LSP tools, formatting, and diagnostics. |
| `--no-pty` | Disable PTY-based interactive bash execution. |
| `--approval-mode <mode>` | Override `tools.approvalMode` for this session (`always-ask`, `write`, or `yolo`). See [approval mode](./approval-mode.md). |
| `--auto-approve`, `--yolo` | Auto-approve all tool calls (skip approval prompts). |
| `--advisor` | Enable the advisor runtime (passively reviews each turn and injects notes). See [advisor / watchdog](./advisor-watchdog.md). |
| `--max-time <duration>` | Stop the session after this duration (e.g. `600`, `10m`, `1h`). |

#### Extensions, hooks, skills, and rules

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--extension <path>`, `-e <path>` | Load an extension (repeatable). See [extensions](./extensions.md). |
| `--hook <path>` | Load a hook/extension file (repeatable). See [hooks](./hooks.md). |
| `--trusted-extension <abs-path>` | Load a trusted extension from an absolute path (repeatable; cannot be combined with `--extension`/`-e`/`--hook`). |
| `--plugin-dir <dir>` | Add a local plugin directory to discovery (repeatable). |
| `--no-extensions` | Disable extension discovery (explicit `-e` paths still work). |
| `--skills <globs>` | Comma-separated glob patterns to filter [skills](./skills.md) (e.g. `git-*,docker`). |
| `--no-skills` | Disable skills discovery and loading. |

#### System prompt

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--system-prompt <text\|file>` | System prompt (default: coding assistant prompt). See [system prompt customization](./system-prompt-customization.md). |
| `--append-system-prompt <text\|file>` | Append text or file contents to the system prompt. |

#### Output mode

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--mode <mode>` | Output/transport mode: `text` (default), `json`, `rpc`, `acp`, or `rpc-ui`. See [output modes](#output-modes---mode). |

#### Information

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show help for `omp` or a subcommand and exit. |
| `--version`, `-v` | Print the installed version and exit. |

### Headless / print mode

`--print` / `-p` runs `omp` non-interactively: it processes the prompt, streams
the result to stdout, and exits without entering the TUI. This is the entry point
for scripting and automation.

```sh
# Print the answer and exit
omp -p "Summarize the changes in the last commit"

# Include the model's thinking blocks in the printed text
omp -p --print-thoughts "Explain your reasoning for this refactor"

# Machine-readable output for pipelines
omp -p --mode json "List every TODO in src/" > todos.json

# Pipe a prompt via stdin
echo "review this diff" | omp -p
```

Related flags for headless runs:

- `--print-thoughts` — include thinking blocks in the printed text output.
- `--mode json` — emit structured events instead of rendered text.
- `--no-title` — skip title auto-generation (also `PI_NO_TITLE`).
- `--max-time <duration>` — bound the run.

The [advisor / watchdog](./advisor-watchdog.md#headless-runs) doc describes
print-mode disposal semantics when the advisor runtime is enabled.

### Output modes (`--mode`)

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `text` | Default. Rendered text output (TUI when interactive, plain text under `--print`). |
| `json` | Structured JSON event stream, for headless/machine consumption. |
| `rpc` | JSON-RPC server over stdio. See [RPC](./rpc.md). |
| `rpc-ui` | RPC transport with UI extension events enabled. |
| `acp` | Agent Client Protocol server over stdio. Equivalent to the [`acp`](#subcommands) subcommand; see [approval mode → ACP sessions](./approval-mode.md#acp-sessions). |

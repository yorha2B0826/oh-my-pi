# RPC Protocol Reference

RPC mode runs the coding agent as a newline-delimited JSON protocol over stdio.

- **stdin**: commands (`RpcCommand`), extension UI responses, host-tool updates/results, and host-URI results
- **stdout**: a ready frame, command responses (`RpcResponse`), session/agent events, extension UI requests, and host-tool/host-URI requests and cancellations

This is a custom JSONL protocol, not JSON-RPC 2.0.

Primary implementation:

- `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/rpc-mode.ts`
- `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/rpc-types.ts`
- `packages/coding-agent/src/session/agent-session.ts`
- `packages/coding-agent/src/session/agent-session-events.ts`
- `packages/agent/src/agent.ts`
- `packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts`

## Startup

```bash
omp --mode rpc [regular CLI options]
```

Behavior notes:

- `@file` CLI arguments are rejected in RPC mode.
- `--no-ui` (with `--mode rpc` or `--mode rpc-ui`) runs extensions headless: `ctx.hasUI` is `false`, dialogs resolve to their defaults, and extension presentation updates are dropped. With `rpc-ui`, tool UI such as `ask` remains enabled. With `rpc`, no UI requests are emitted except for a host-issued `login`. See [Extension UI Sub-Protocol](#extension-ui-sub-protocol) for the exact boundaries.
- CLI RPC modes disable automatic session title generation (`PI_NO_TITLE=1`) to avoid an extra model call. `rpc-ui` also sets `PI_NO_PTY=1`.
- RPC/ACP pin neutral defaults for settings declaring the corresponding `protocolDefault`, including task isolation/execution, memory, advisor, and advisor tier settings. RPC additionally pins async-job and bash/eval auto-background defaults. Explicit project/global config, `--config`, and isolated settings remain authoritative; on-disk config changes are watched in long-lived CLI RPC processes. Todo settings are not host-defaulted.
- The process claims stdin before extension discovery, then parses it one non-empty JSONL line at a time. Malformed JSON emits a recoverable `command: "parse"` failure and does not terminate the loop.
- At startup it writes a `ready` frame before processing commands. The frame advertises supported protocol versions and transport limits.
- When stdin closes, pending extension UI, host-tool, and host-URI requests are rejected; accepted commands are drained, the session is disposed, pending stdout is delivered, and normal shutdown exits with code `0`. A session-persistence failure still latched at disposal exits with code `1` after delivering its `notice` frame.
- Responses/events are written as one JSON object per line.

## Transport and Framing

Protocol v1 stdout frames are a single JSON object followed by `\n`. The server caps each physical stdout frame at 1 MiB, including the newline. Inbound frames are always one unchunked JSONL object; clients SHOULD keep them within the advertised physical-frame limit. Input is not reassembled from `rpc_chunk` frames.

The initial ready frame uses protocol v1 and advertises the opt-in lossless transport:

```json
{
  "type": "ready",
  "protocolVersion": 1,
  "supportedProtocolVersions": [1, 2],
  "maxFrameBytes": 1048576,
  "maxReassembledFrameBytes": 67108864
}
```

Clients that support protocol v2 SHOULD immediately send:

```json
{ "id": "protocol-1", "type": "negotiate_protocol", "protocolVersion": 2 }
```

After the success response, oversized stdout objects use an uninterrupted sequence of `rpc_chunk` frames rather than content truncation. Each chunk carries a base64 segment of the UTF-8 JSON object:

```json
{
  "type": "rpc_chunk",
  "chunkId": "rpc-1",
  "index": 0,
  "count": 7,
  "byteLength": 1600042,
  "data": "eyJ0eXBlIjoicmVzcG9uc2UiLC4uLn0="
}
```

Clients MUST validate `chunkId`, `index`, `count`, and `byteLength`, reject interleaved or interrupted sequences, enforce the advertised reassembly limit, concatenate decoded bytes in index order, decode them as strict UTF-8, and parse the result as one JSON object. The TypeScript `RpcFrameDecoder`, exported from `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent/modes/rpc/rpc-frame`, implements this validation. The bundled TypeScript and Python `RpcClient` implementations and the Rust and Go clients negotiate v2 automatically when the ready frame advertises it.

For an oversized `agent_end` in either version, the encoder first removes the leading messages already delivered unchanged in `message_end` frames and adds `messageCount` with the original count. Hosts must retain streamed messages rather than treating `agent_end.messages` as a complete transcript.

Legacy clients may ignore the added ready fields and remain on v1. In v1, an oversized response becomes `success: false` with `error: "RPC response exceeded the transport limit"`; oversized events may have strings, arrays, or object fields elided. If a v2 logical frame exceeds 64 MiB after terminal-frame compaction, responses receive the same overflow error, other events produce `rpc_frame_error`, and `agent_end` falls back to an empty `messages` array plus `messageCount`. Large history APIs should use pagination rather than depending on arbitrarily large logical frames.

Output goes directly to stdout while the reader keeps up. Under backpressure, the server spills pending bytes to a private temporary file and drains it in 64 KiB blocks, preserving frame order. This limits queued output memory at the cost of disk I/O and temporary disk usage, which can grow until the reader catches up. The file is removed when the backlog drains or the process shuts down. Output or spool failures are logged, dispose the session, and exit with code `1`.

Clients MUST continue reading stdout after closing stdin. Normal EOF and extension-requested shutdown wait for pending output delivery; a client that keeps its stdout pipe open without reading can delay exit indefinitely.

### Outbound frame categories (stdout)

1. Ready frame (`{ type: "ready" }`)
2. `RpcResponse` (`{ type: "response", ... }`)
3. `AgentSessionEvent` objects (`agent_start`, `message_update`, etc.)
4. `RpcExtensionUIRequest` (`{ type: "extension_ui_request", ... }`)
5. Host tool requests/cancellations (`host_tool_call`, `host_tool_cancel`)
6. Host URI requests/cancellations (`host_uri_request`, `host_uri_cancel`)
7. Extension errors (`{ type: "extension_error", extensionPath, event, error }`)
8. Available-commands updates (`{ type: "available_commands_update", commands }`), emitted at startup and whenever command metadata changes
9. Prompt completion (`{ type: "prompt_result", id?, agentInvoked, status, error?, sessionSettled }`), unless the response already completed the prompt locally; see [`prompt` payload](#prompt-payload)
10. Session quiescence (`{ type: "session_settled" }`); see [Yield vs settled](#yield-vs-settled)
11. Subagent frames (`subagent_lifecycle`, `subagent_progress`, `subagent_event`), gated by `set_subagent_subscription`
12. Builtin slash-command side channels (`command_output`, `session_info_update`, `config_update`)
13. Transport overflow notifications (`rpc_frame_error`), when an event cannot fit within the transport limits
14. Live voice frames (`live_phase`, `live_levels`, `live_transcript`, `live_end`); see [Live Voice Sub-Protocol](#live-voice-sub-protocol)

Protocol v2 may wrap oversized logical frames from these categories in `rpc_chunk` frames.

### Inbound frame categories (stdin)

1. `RpcCommand`
2. `RpcExtensionUIResponse` (`{ type: "extension_ui_response", ... }`)
3. Host tool updates/results (`host_tool_update`, `host_tool_result`)
4. Host URI results (`host_uri_result`)

## Request/Response Correlation

All commands accept optional `id?: string`.

- If provided, normal command responses echo the same `id`.
- `RpcClient` relies on this for pending-request resolution.

Important edge behavior from runtime:

- Unknown command responses echo the request `id` when one was provided.
- Malformed JSON and synchronous dispatch failures emit `command: "parse"` without an `id`. Exceptions while handling a recognized command emit a failure with that command's `type` and `id`.
- Ordinary `prompt` handling acknowledges after the message is admitted (queued, given an idle turn slot, or routed to an extension command), not before native `input` handlers or image preparation finish, and without waiting for the agent run. `abort_and_prompt` first awaits the abort, then acknowledges. A failure before admission is the command's error response. A failure after admission can still emit a later error response with the same `id`.
- An accepted `prompt` or `abort_and_prompt` completes exactly once: either its success response carries `data.agentInvoked: false` (finished locally), or a later `prompt_result` frame with the same `id` reports how its work ended. `prompt_result` is always written after the response for that `id`.

## Command Schema (canonical)

`RpcCommand` is defined in `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/rpc-types.ts`:

### Prompting

- `{ id?, type: "prompt", message: string, images?: ImageContent[], streamingBehavior?: "steer" | "followUp" }`
- `{ id?, type: "steer", message: string, images?: ImageContent[] }`
- `{ id?, type: "follow_up", message: string, images?: ImageContent[] }`
- `{ id?, type: "remove_queued_message", message: string, queue: "steering" | "followUp" }`
- `{ id?, type: "promote_queued_message", message: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "abort" }`
- `{ id?, type: "abort_and_prompt", message: string, images?: ImageContent[] }`
- `{ id?, type: "new_session", parentSession?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "open_session", sessionDir: string, provider?: string, modelId?: string }`

### Protocol

- `{ id?, type: "negotiate_protocol", protocolVersion: 2 }`

### State

- `{ id?, type: "get_state" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_fast_mode", enabled: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "goal", op: "get" | "create" | "resume" | "pause" | "drop", objective?: string, token_budget?: number }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_ask_dialog", enabled: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_available_commands" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_entries", since?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_tree" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_todos", phases: TodoPhase[] }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_host_tools", tools: RpcHostToolDefinition[] }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_host_uri_schemes", schemes: RpcHostUriSchemeDefinition[] }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_subagent_subscription", level: "off" | "progress" | "events" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_event_filter", events: string[] | null, messageUpdates?: "full" | "delta" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_subagents" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_subagent_messages", subagentId?: string, sessionFile?: string, fromByte?: number }`
- `{ id?, type: "cancel_subagent", subagentId: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "steer_subagent", subagentId: string, message: string }`

### Model

- `{ id?, type: "set_model", provider: string, modelId: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "cycle_model" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_available_models" }`

`get_available_models` waits for background model discovery before returning. `set_model` also waits when the requested model is not already in the available catalog; it returns the selected `Model` or a `Model not found: <provider>/<modelId>` failure.

### Thinking

- `{ id?, type: "set_thinking_level", level: ThinkingLevel }`
- `{ id?, type: "cycle_thinking_level" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_available_thinking_levels" }`

`ThinkingLevel` is `"inherit" | "off" | "minimal" | "low" | "medium" | "high" | "xhigh" | "max"`. Discovery returns `"off"` followed by the live model's supported efforts, omitting `"inherit"` and the session-only `"auto"` selector.

### Queue modes

- `{ id?, type: "set_steering_mode", mode: "all" | "one-at-a-time" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_follow_up_mode", mode: "all" | "one-at-a-time" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_interrupt_mode", mode: "immediate" | "wait" }`

### Compaction

- `{ id?, type: "compact", customInstructions?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_auto_compaction", enabled: boolean }`

### Cache warming

- `{ id?, type: "set_cache_warming", mode: "off" | "streaming" | "idle" }`

Sets `providers.cacheWarming` for the current session without writing `config.yml`.
`off` clears scheduled refreshes and aborts any refresh in flight; `streaming`
warms during active agent runs; `idle` also warms between runs. Enabling warming
does not replay an old, cancelled run: the next real provider request arms it.
Invalid modes return the usual `success: false` response. Success reports the
effective mode after applying the override:

```json
{"id":"warming-off","type":"response","command":"set_cache_warming","success":true,"data":{"mode":"off"}}
```

The TypeScript client exposes `setCacheWarming(mode): Promise<CacheWarmingMode>`.

### Retry

- `{ id?, type: "set_auto_retry", enabled: boolean }`
- `{ id?, type: "abort_retry" }`

### Bash

- `{ id?, type: "bash", command: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "abort_bash" }`

`bash` is dispatched concurrently: the RPC server continues reading commands
while the shell command runs, so `abort_bash` (or any other command) sent
during a long-running `bash` is handled without waiting for it to finish on
its own. The `bash` response is emitted when the command completes; hosts
correlate it via `id`. Ordering across concurrent commands is not guaranteed
— clients MUST match responses on `id`, not on emission order.

### Session

- `{ id?, type: "get_session_stats" }`
- `{ id?, type: "export_html", outputPath?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "switch_session", sessionPath: string, provider?: string, modelId?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "branch", entryId: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "fork", entryId?: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_branch_messages" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_last_assistant_text" }`
- `{ id?, type: "set_session_name", name: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "handoff", customInstructions?: string }`

`handoff` fails while a response is streaming. On success, its payload is `{ savedPath? }` or `null` when no handoff was produced. Session transitions (`new_session`, `switch_session`, `branch`, `fork`, `open_session`) report cancellation when an extension prevents the transition.

`fork` moves the process onto a new session file and returns `{ cancelled }`; read the new `sessionFile`/`sessionId` with `get_state`. With `entryId` (any `message` entry from `get_entries`, such as a user or assistant message), the new file holds the root-to-entry path including that entry plus the session's artifacts, so kept `artifact://` references still resolve, and its header's `parentSession` is the old session file. When `entryId` sits inside an assistant tool-call batch (the assistant message itself, or one of its tool results), the cut extends through the batch's recorded tool results so the fork never ends on tool calls whose results were dropped. This runs `session_before_branch`/`session_branch` hooks with reason `"fork"`, and the hook's `entryId` is the last kept entry. Without `entryId` it copies the whole session and its artifacts (`/fork`), records the old session id as `parentSession`, runs `session_before_switch`/`session_switch` with reason `"fork"`, and reports `cancelled: true` when the session is not persisted. A non-message `entryId` fails. Both variants fail with `code: "session_busy"` while a response is streaming or bash, eval, compaction, handoff, or retry work is running, including work that starts while the fork's hooks or flushes are awaited; a refused fork keeps the current session, its transcript, and its queued next-turn messages and background jobs. The Python client exposes `fork(entry_id=None) -> CancellationResult`.

### Messages

- `{ id?, type: "get_messages" }`
- `{ id?, type: "get_messages_page", cursor?: string, limit?: number }`

`get_messages_page` returns a stable chronological page with `messages`, `totalMessages`, and an opaque `nextCursor` when more messages remain. Cursors are bound to the session ID, durable leaf, and message count. The server rejects stale cursors if the session changes between requests, and refuses to start a paging walk while the session is streaming or compacting. Failed page requests carry a machine-readable `code` on the error response — `session_busy` (session is streaming or compacting) or `stale_cursor` (the snapshot behind the cursor changed, e.g. a background bash appended a message between pages) — so clients can react without matching error-message text. Pages default to 100 messages; `limit` must be an integer from 1 through 256. The page builder normally caps serialized message content at 768 KiB, but always includes at least one message, so a single large message can exceed that budget. A v1 caller can page ordinary histories, but an individual message whose response exceeds the 1 MiB physical-frame ceiling produces an overflow error; retrieving it losslessly requires negotiated v2 framing.

The bundled TypeScript `RpcClient.getMessages()` and Python `RpcClient.get_messages()` drain this paged endpoint automatically after negotiating v2. They retain the legacy monolithic command when connected to a v1 server, and on either `session_busy` or `stale_cursor` they discard partial pages and fall back to the legacy best-effort snapshot. Direct `getMessagesPage()` and `get_messages_page()` calls remain strict so incremental hosts never mix snapshots silently.

### Login

- `{ id?, type: "get_login_providers" }`
- `{ id?, type: "login", providerId: string }`

Login forwards ordinary OAuth input prompts only after the provider emits an
authorization URL. Prompts marked `secret: true` are always rejected with a
failed `login` response directing the user to the terminal UI; no ordinary
`input` request is emitted. RPC does not negotiate secret-input support.

### Word prediction

- `{ id?, type: "predict_word", text: string, cursor: number }` → `data: { suffix: string | null }`
- `{ id?, type: "predict_word_feedback", text: string, cursor: number, suggestion: string, accepted: boolean }`

Composer ghost text for hosts that render their own input box. `text` is the
whole draft and `cursor` a UTF-16 offset into it. The server applies the same
gates as the terminal editor (the cursor must sit at the end of its line and
end a prose word; code, paths, and slash commands get nothing) and answers from the engine selected by
`spelling.autocomplete`; `off` always answers `suffix: null`.

`predict_word` is dispatched concurrently like `bash`, so a slow prediction
never delays other commands; match responses on `id`. Per session the server
keeps one engine request in flight: a request arriving while one runs waits,
and a newer one replaces it, answering the replaced request `suffix: null`.
Hosts may send on every keystroke; only the newest draft reaches the engine.

The first request may take seconds (worst case about two minutes) while the
shared prediction daemon starts and loads its engine. When the daemon cannot
start or answer, `predict_word` fails (`success: false`), and keeps failing
fast for about 30 seconds while the daemon is backed off. Treat failures as
"no ghost text" rather than surfacing them per keystroke.

Send `predict_word_feedback` with the `text` and `cursor` at which a
suggestion was shown: `accepted: true` when the user took it, `false` when
they typed past it. Feedback tunes the engine's learned state.

## Response Schema

All command results use `RpcResponse`:

- Success: `{ id?, type: "response", command: <command>, success: true, data?: ... }`
- Failure: `{ id?, type: "response", command: string, success: false, error: string, code?: string }`

Data payloads are command-specific and defined in `rpc-types.ts`.

### `prompt` payload

`prompt` is acknowledged once the message is admitted — an idle turn has started for it, it has been pushed onto the steer/follow-up/aside queue while the agent is busy, or it has been routed to a registered extension command (before that command's handler runs) — not after a model turn finishes. Admission runs any image normalization first (and, for a text-only model with vision description enabled, the vision-description call), so those complete before the acknowledgement. The vision-description call is capped at 20 seconds, which keeps the acknowledgement inside the bundled clients' 30-second request timeout; past the cap the image is still saved and the model is told its description is unavailable. The same applies to a `/skill:` invocation sent through `prompt`. A prompt that settles without ever being admitted (dropped by an `abort`, or failing first) is acknowledged once it settles. Gating the acknowledgement does not change completion: the prompt still completes exactly once, through `data.agentInvoked: false` or its `prompt_result` (below).

`prompt` starts after previously received ordinary commands, such as `new_session` or `set_model`, have completed. Its admission then runs in the background: the RPC server keeps handling later commands — `abort`, `steer`, `follow_up`, `get_state`, and so on — without waiting for slow image normalization or vision description. An `abort` that lands while a prompt's images are still being prepared cancels the vision-description call and drops the prompt, whether it would have started an idle turn or been queued with `streamingBehavior`.

```json
{
  "id": "req_1",
  "type": "response",
  "command": "prompt",
  "success": true,
  "data": { "agentInvoked": false }
}
```

`data.agentInvoked: false` is the completion signal for builtin slash commands that finish synchronously without starting an agent turn; no `prompt_result` follows. Every other accepted `prompt` (and every `abort_and_prompt`) is completed by one `prompt_result` frame carrying the command `id`, once its local outcome or agent yield is known. Background work need not have settled:

```json
{ "type": "prompt_result", "id": "req_1", "agentInvoked": true, "status": "completed", "sessionSettled": true }
```

- `agentInvoked: false`: the prompt finished locally (an extension or custom command that started no turn) or failed before reaching the agent.
- `agentInvoked: true`: the prompt was dispatched or queued for agent work; normal completion reports when the agent **yielded** — see [Yield vs settled](#yield-vs-settled). An abort that wins before dispatch can still report `true` with `status: "aborted"`. A prompt dispatched as a fresh turn reports the first run that started after it was accepted, so a late `agent_end` from an earlier run never completes it. A prompt queued into a live run (`streamingBehavior`) reports at the first yield after its message left the queue. An `agent_end` with `yielded: false` (the agent is retrying, compacting, or answering a stop-time reminder) never completes a prompt.
- `status`: `"completed"`, `"aborted"` (interrupted by `abort`, `abort_and_prompt`, or a session transition, or dropped by an abort before dispatch), or `"error"`.
- `error` (only with `status: "error"`): `{ message, provider?, model?, httpStatus?, retryable }`. `message` is the provider's error text with OMP-local diagnostics (such as saved request-dump paths) removed. `retryable` marks a transient failure; OMP's own automatic retries have already been exhausted. A prompt that fails before reaching the agent also gets the legacy error response with the same `id` before its `prompt_result`.
- `sessionSettled`: whether the session is already done when the result is written — see [Yield vs settled](#yield-vs-settled). `false` means background work can still wake the agent; a `session_settled` frame follows once it has.

A failed provider turn is not a failed command: the prompt response is still `success: true`, and the turn ends with a normal terminal `agent_end` whose last assistant message has `stopReason: "error"`. Use `prompt_result.status` rather than parsing that message.

Local-only slash commands may emit `command_output` frames before completing. They do not emit `agent_end`.

### Yield vs settled

For agent-invoking work, a prompt's `prompt_result` reports the **agent yield**: it finished its turn (`agent_end` with `yielded: true`), or the prompt was aborted before dispatch or by a session transition. Local-only results and pre-dispatch errors do not require an `agent_end`. The **session is done** only when nothing can wake it again — no run is live or admitted, no steer/follow-up is queued, and no background job (auto-backgrounded `bash`, async `task`, `eval`) or pending delivery will inject its result and start a follow-up turn.

- `session_settled` is written once per stretch of agent activity, when the session becomes done. If background work was pending at the yield, OMP waits it out; any follow-up runs it triggers stream normally (`agent_start` … `agent_end`) before `session_settled`. It always follows the `prompt_result` frames of the final yield, and is not emitted for prompts that never reached the agent.
- `prompt_result.sessionSettled` answers the same question at the yield, so a host can tear down immediately when it is `true`.
- `get_state` reports `isSettled` (same predicate) and `hasPendingAsyncWork`, for hosts that attach mid-stream.

Wait on `prompt_result` to present a turn's answer; wait on `session_settled` (or `isSettled`) before treating the conversation as finished, e.g. before pausing or recycling a sandbox.

### `open_session` payload

`open_session` binds the process to a host-keyed conversation directory — the runtime equivalent of `--session-dir <dir> --continue`, so a pre-spawned process can adopt a thread after startup. It continues the newest non-empty session in `sessionDir`, or starts a fresh session there when none exists. Reopening the session that is already active (including a still-empty fresh session in the same directory) is a no-op that does not interrupt a running turn; otherwise the current run is aborted as with `switch_session`, and open prompts complete with `status: "aborted"`.

```json
{ "cancelled": false, "resumed": true, "sessionId": "01a0...", "sessionFile": "/srv/threads/t1/2026-...jsonl" }
```

`resumed` is `false` when a fresh session was started. The command fails when the process runs without persistence (`--no-session`).

A successful `open_session` also marks still-open RPC prompt tickets aborted, even for an already-open directory; in that no-op case the underlying turn continues streaming. `cancelled: true` leaves the active session and prompt tickets unchanged.

A resumed session restores its saved model, as `--continue` does. When none of its saved models can be restored (for example, after a model id rename or with no credentials for the provider), `open_session` fails with `Could not restore model <provider/id>` rather than send the transcript to another model. The previous session stays active, and the process keeps serving, but a turn that was running in it has been aborted, as with any session switch. `switch_session` fails the same way.

To bind with a specific model instead, pass `provider` and `modelId` together, as in `set_model`. Like `--model` at startup, they replace the saved model and skip its check. An unknown pair fails with `Model not found: <provider>/<modelId>` before any session change. A resumed session records the model when it differs from the saved one, and an already-open or fresh session selects it as `set_model` does. `switch_session` accepts the same pair.

```json
{ "id": "open-1", "type": "open_session", "sessionDir": "/srv/threads/t1", "provider": "anthropic", "modelId": "claude-sonnet-4-5" }
```

### `remove_queued_message` payload

Remove the first matching user-authored message from the selected pending queue:

```json
{"id":"req_2","type":"remove_queued_message","message":"Use the existing parser","queue":"steering"}
{"id":"req_2","type":"response","command":"remove_queued_message","success":true,"data":{"removed":true}}
```

`message` first matches the original submitted text retained before slash/custom-command rewriting, prompt-template expansion, or `^model` mention substitution; if that finds nothing, it matches the exact queue-chip text. Removal never reruns a command or template to find a match. Queued RPC skill commands retain their original `/skill:<name>` invocation as the chip text. Removal also drops that message's attachments and contiguous preceding hidden user companions (keyword notices, image descriptions, and video source paths), preserving other messages and the other queue.

Companions and their prompt are enqueued and dequeued as a complete group, including in `one-at-a-time` mode. Once that group leaves the pending queue for delivery, a removal request cannot report success after only part of its context has been emitted.

Agent-authored entries never match, including internal handoffs with `role: "user"` and `attribution: "agent"`. With duplicate text, each request removes only the first matching occurrence; repeating a successful request can remove another occurrence.

The check and removal are synchronous: `data.removed: false` means no matching user message is pending in that queue at dispatch time. Already-dequeued messages and inputs still being preprocessed cannot be cancelled by this command. Live-steered input may remain visible in queue snapshots until the transcript records it, even though it has already left the removable pending queue. It does not resend input, abort a turn, or change interruption behavior. Non-string `message` values and missing or invalid `queue` values produce an error response.

A removal request may hide the chip or restore its draft only after `removed: true`; normal delivery still removes chips through queue snapshots. Older runtimes reject this command; clients must not fall back to aborting or resending queued messages. The TypeScript client exposes `removeQueuedMessage(message, queue): Promise<{ removed: boolean }>`.

The official Python client exposes `remove_queued_message(message, queue) -> RemoveQueuedMessageResult`; inspect its `.removed` boolean rather than the result object's truthiness.

### `promote_queued_message` payload

Move the first matching user-authored follow-up to the end of the steering queue:

```json
{"id":"req_3","type":"promote_queued_message","message":"Use the existing parser"}
{"id":"req_3","type":"response","command":"promote_queued_message","success":true,"data":{"promoted":true}}
```

The command moves the existing queued message, including its attachments and contiguous preceding hidden user companions, without reprocessing or duplicating it. `message` matches exactly as for `remove_queued_message`, so agent-authored entries never match. With duplicate text, each request moves only the first matching follow-up; repeating a successful request can move another occurrence.

`data.promoted: false` means no matching user follow-up is pending at dispatch time (for example, it was already delivered). Non-string `message` values produce an error response. Existing steering, follow-up, and interrupt modes still apply; promotion does not abort the model stream or guarantee cancellation of running tools. While the agent is idle, a promoted message starts a turn right away, including after a user `abort` — promoting is an explicit request to steer now. The move is reported as one `queue_update` in which the message has already left `followUp` and joined `steering`.

Since `prompt` acknowledges only once the message is admitted (see above), a `promote_queued_message` sent immediately after a queued `prompt`'s acknowledgement reliably observes it. Older runtimes reject this command; clients must not fall back to `steer`, which would enqueue a duplicate. The TypeScript client exposes `promoteQueuedMessage(message): Promise<{ promoted: boolean }>`, and its `prompt(message, images?, streamingBehavior?)` accepts `"steer"` or `"followUp"` to queue a prompt sent while the agent is busy.

The official Python client exposes `promote_queued_message(message) -> PromoteQueuedMessageResult`; inspect its `.promoted` boolean rather than the result object's truthiness.

### `get_state` payload

`tokensPerSecond` is a number when output throughput is available and `null`
otherwise. `fastModeEnabled` reports the session's selected model-family tier
(`priority` or `ultrafast`), while `fastModeActive` reports the actual computed
active state. For Fireworks, `providers.fireworksTier: priority` is independent
of the `/fast` family setting, so `fastModeActive` may remain `true` for a model
that `/fast` cannot toggle. Fireworks `-fast` serving variants do not use priority.

For direct Anthropic, a provider rejection of `speed: "fast"` uses a sticky
fallback scoped by the resolved endpoint and exact model: `fastModeEnabled` may
remain `true` while `fastModeActive` is `false`. An explicit `set_fast_mode`
enable expresses retry intent and clears that fallback so the provider attempt
is re-armed.

```json
{
  "model": { "provider": "...", "id": "..." },
  "thinkingLevel": "off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max",
  "isStreaming": false,
  "isCompacting": false,
  "steeringMode": "all|one-at-a-time",
  "followUpMode": "all|one-at-a-time",
  "interruptMode": "immediate|wait",
  "sessionFile": "...",
  "sessionId": "...",
  "sessionName": "...",
  "fastModeEnabled": false,
  "tokensPerSecond": null,
  "fastModeActive": false,
  "autoCompactionEnabled": true,
  "messageCount": 0,
  "queuedMessageCount": 0,
  "hasPendingAsyncWork": false,
  "isSettled": true,
  "queuedMessages": { "steering": [], "followUp": [] },
  "todoPhases": [
    {
      "name": "Todos",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "content": "Map the tool surface",
          "status": "in_progress"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "systemPrompt": ["..."],
  "dumpTools": [
    {
      "name": "read",
      "description": "Read files and URLs",
      "parameters": {}
    }
  ],
  "contextUsage": {
    "tokens": 1100,
    "contextWindow": 200000,
    "percent": 0.55
  },
  "goal": null
}
```

Fields whose values are `undefined` are omitted from JSON, including an unset
model/thinking level, session name/file, or unavailable `contextUsage`.
`dumpTools` may also include each tool's `examples` alongside its schema.

`queuedMessages` holds the same displayable queue-chip text as the `queue_update`
event below. Use this text with `remove_queued_message`, subject to its pending-queue
boundary: live-steered input stays visible until recorded but is no longer removable.
Clients should render the queue from these snapshots instead of tracking chips
independently, and treat removal responses as confirmation rather than a second
source of truth. `queuedMessageCount` also includes advisor cards and pending
next-turn messages, so it is not necessarily the number of user-authored chips.

### `goal` payload

`goal` manages goal mode with the same lifecycle as the interactive `/goal` command.
Every op answers `{ goal: Goal | null, state: GoalModeState | null }`; `get_state`
carries the same state as `goal`. `goal_updated` events report every change,
including those made by the agent's `goal` tool.

- `get` only reads. It never starts a turn.
- `create` needs `goal.enabled`, a non-empty `objective`, and no active or paused
  goal. It is refused in plan mode, and `token_budget` must be a positive integer.
  It adds the `goal` tool to the active tools.
- `resume` resumes a paused goal (refused in plan mode). `pause` and `drop` restore
  the active tools from before the goal started.
- Failures are ordinary `success: false` responses.

Goals do not continue on their own over RPC unless `goal.continuationModes`
contains `"rpc"`; this covers both `--mode rpc` and `--mode rpc-ui`. When enabled,
`create`/`resume` and each terminal `agent_end` decide whether to start another goal
turn, sent as a hidden `goal-continuation` message.

- The turn starts once the yielding run has fully unwound. At that moment the goal
  must still be active, the session idle with nothing queued, plan mode off, open
  todos not all blocked, and the session not being disposed.
- While the turn is decided but not yet started, `get_state.isSettled`,
  `prompt_result.sessionSettled` and `session_settled` treat the session as busy.
  `session_settled` follows if the continuation is abandoned.
- `abort` stops continuation before the abort takes effect and pauses the
  interrupted goal, so a later prompt does not restart it; only `goal resume` does
  (or `drop` and a new `create`).
- Continuation also stops after a goal turn with no new tool activity. The next
  turn that is not itself a goal continuation (a host prompt, steer or follow-up,
  for example) re-arms it.
- A session change leaves the previous goal and its tool behind and restores a goal
  journaled in the target session. This covers `new_session`, `switch_session`,
  `branch`, `fork` and `open_session`, and the same changes made by extension commands. As
  in the TUI, an active goal stays active across such a change and continues; a goal
  restored when the process starts is paused until `goal resume`. A change is
  detected by the transcript id, so a host-pinned `--provider-session-id` does not
  hide it. A goal turn that is waiting or becomes due while a change is in progress
  is held. If the change is cancelled, or leaves the session unchanged (tree
  navigation, reopening the open session), the goal continues. While such a turn is
  held, the session is not reported as settled.

When the agent completes the goal, the goal tool is removed again and
`get_state.goal` becomes `null`.

### `set_fast_mode` payload

`set_fast_mode` changes whether fast mode is enabled for the session. The
request is:

```json
{ "id": "req_fast_on", "type": "set_fast_mode", "enabled": true }
```

On success, `data` always contains both `enabled` and `active`. These are the
actual computed values: `enabled` reports the session setting, and `active`
reports the resulting active state, including any provider-level Fireworks
priority setting:

For direct Anthropic, an explicit enable also re-arms a provider attempt after
the sticky rejection fallback, even when fast mode was already enabled.

```json
{
  "id": "req_fast_on",
  "type": "response",
  "command": "set_fast_mode",
  "success": true,
  "data": { "enabled": true, "active": true }
}
```

Enabling fast mode on a model without a service-tier family, or an OpenAI-family
model that does not offer the priority tier, fails with the error below:

```json
{
  "id": "req_fast_on",
  "type": "response",
  "command": "set_fast_mode",
  "success": false,
  "error": "Fast mode is unavailable for the current model."
}
```

Disabling fast mode is idempotent, including on an unsupported model. It
succeeds as an off/no-op result, but disabling `/fast` does not override
provider-level settings, so a successful disable does not guarantee
`active: false`. For example, with an unsupported
`fireworks/deepseek-v4-flash` model and `providers.fireworksTier: priority`,
the response reports the session setting as disabled while the provider
priority keeps the computed active state true:

```json
{
  "id": "req_fast_off",
  "type": "response",
  "command": "set_fast_mode",
  "success": true,
  "data": { "enabled": false, "active": true }
}
```

The corresponding `get_state` result reports the same computed state:

```json
{
  "fastModeEnabled": false,
  "fastModeActive": true
}
```

### `set_ask_dialog` payload

`set_ask_dialog` opts the host in to the `ask` extension UI request (see
[Extension UI Sub-Protocol](#extension-ui-sub-protocol)). It is off by default
for every process; until a host enables it, the `ask` tool keeps prompting with
one `select` (plus `editor` for free text) per choice. Builds without the
command answer with a failed `response`, so hosts should keep the `select`
fallback when enabling fails.

```json
{ "id": "req_ask", "type": "set_ask_dialog", "enabled": true }
```

```json
{
  "id": "req_ask",
  "type": "response",
  "command": "set_ask_dialog",
  "success": true,
  "data": { "enabled": true }
}
```

### `set_todos` payload

Replaces the in-memory todo state for the current session and returns `{ todoPhases }`.
Phases use `{ name, tasks }`; tasks retain `{ content, status, blocker? }`. There
are no phase or task IDs. Status is `"pending"`, `"in_progress"`, `"completed"`,
`"abandoned"`, or `"blocked"`. Snapshot cloning drops extra fields, including
task `details` and `notes`.

```json
{
  "id": "req_2",
  "type": "set_todos",
  "phases": [
    {
      "name": "Evaluation",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "content": "Map the read tool surface",
          "status": "in_progress"
        },
        {
          "content": "Exercise edit operations",
          "status": "pending"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This is useful for hosts that want to pre-seed a plan before the first prompt.

### `set_host_tools` payload

Replaces the current set of host-owned tools that the RPC server may call back
into over stdio:

```json
{
  "id": "req_3",
  "type": "set_host_tools",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "echo_host",
      "label": "Echo Host",
      "description": "Echo a value from the embedding host",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "message": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["message"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The response payload is:

```json
{
  "toolNames": ["echo_host"]
}
```

These tools are registered before the next model call. New non-hidden tools
are enabled automatically; new hidden tools are registered without being enabled.
Re-sending `set_host_tools` replaces the previous host-owned set, preserving the
enabled state of surviving host tools. Names must be unique and cannot conflict
with an existing non-host tool.

Definitions also accept `hidden?: boolean`,
`loadMode?: "essential" | "discoverable"`, and `readsSkillUris?: boolean`.
Set `readsSkillUris: true` when the tool can read `skill://` instruction content;
prompt builders use this capability to decide whether to include skill guidance.
An explicit load mode wins. When omitted, known essential built-in names remain
`"essential"`; other host tools default to `"discoverable"`. `toolNames` in the
response lists the registered names.

### `set_host_uri_schemes` payload

Replaces the current set of host-owned URL schemes the RPC server should
dispatch reads/writes through:

```json
{
  "id": "req_4",
  "type": "set_host_uri_schemes",
  "schemes": [
    {
      "scheme": "db",
      "description": "Virtual db row files",
      "writable": true,
      "immutable": false
    }
  ]
}
```

The response payload is:

```json
{
  "schemes": ["db"]
}
```

Scheme names are trimmed and lowercased and must match `[a-z][a-z0-9+.-]*`.
`writable` and `immutable` default to `false`. Re-sending `set_host_uri_schemes`
replaces the entire previous set — schemes missing from the new list are
unregistered; an empty list clears all host schemes.

Every built-in scheme (`local://`, `skill://`, `artifact://`, `security://`,
`mcp://`, …) is reserved: RPC hosts cannot register or shadow one, and the
request fails with `Host URI scheme is reserved by OMP: <scheme>://`.

## Event Stream Schema

RPC mode forwards `AgentSessionEvent` objects from `AgentSession.subscribe(...)`.

Common event types:

- `agent_start`, `agent_end`
- `turn_start`, `turn_end`
- `message_start`, `message_update`, `message_end`
- `tool_execution_start`, `tool_execution_update`, `tool_stream_update`, `tool_execution_end`
- `auto_compaction_start`, `auto_compaction_end`
- `auto_retry_start`, `auto_retry_end`
- `cache_warming_start`, `cache_warming_end`
- `retry_fallback_applied`, `retry_fallback_succeeded`
- `model_changed`, `thinking_level_changed`, `config_warnings_changed`
- `advisor_cost_changed`, `advisor_yielded`
- `ttsr_triggered`
- `todo_reminder`, `todo_auto_clear`
- `irc_message`, `notice`, `goal_updated`
- `queue_update`

### `queue_update` event

```json
{ "type": "queue_update", "steering": ["Use the existing parser"], "followUp": [] }
```

Emitted whenever the displayable steering/follow-up queue changes: a `steer`,
`follow_up`, or queued `prompt` adds to it; delivery into the transcript,
`remove_queued_message`, an abort that drops in-flight queued messages,
or a session switch removes from or clears it. The server coalesces this
against the last value sent — a mutation that leaves the snapshot unchanged
(for example, an agent-authored aside that never renders as a chip) never
re-emits. `steering`/`followUp` mirror `get_state`'s `queuedMessages` field and
carry the queue-chip text accepted by `remove_queued_message` while the message
is still pending. Live-steered messages stay listed until recorded in the
transcript, even after they cease to be removable. Render the queue from this
event rather than tracking chips independently, and treat removal replies as
confirmation of a change rather than independent queue state.

Extension runner errors are emitted separately as:

```json
{
  "type": "extension_error",
  "extensionPath": "...",
  "event": "...",
  "error": "..."
}
```

`message_update` includes streaming deltas in `assistantMessageEvent` (text/thinking/toolcall deltas).

`message_start`, `message_update`, and `message_end` carry a `messageId` string assigned by RPC mode. One message keeps the same id from its start through every update to its end; ids are unique within the process. Records injected mid-stream (advisor cards, IRC messages) get their own id and do not disturb the id of the reply streaming around them.

`set_event_filter` restricts which session event frames are written: pass the event `type` strings to forward, or `null` to forward everything (the default). The response echoes the active selection as `{ events, messageUpdates }`. The filter applies to all events emitted through the session subscription, not just the common types listed above; every other outbound category (responses, `prompt_result`, `session_settled`, extension UI and host tool/URI requests, `extension_error`, `available_commands_update`, subagent frames, builtin slash-command side channels, and session-persistence `notice` frames) is unaffected by this filter. Hosts that fail closed on unknown event kinds can pin the set they understand here instead of breaking when OMP adds an event.

The optional `messageUpdates: "delta"` projects only `message_update` frames to `{ type: "message_update", messageId, message: { role }, assistantMessageEvent }`: `assistantMessageEvent.partial` is omitted, while all other event fields (including subtype, `delta`, and `contentIndex`) are preserved. `message_start`, `message_end`, and all other frames are unchanged; `message_end` still carries the full message. Block-ending events such as `text_end`, `thinking_end`, and `toolcall_end` retain their block content or tool call, so hosts must still accept chunked protocol-v2 frames for large blocks and full messages. Switching modes mid-message does not change its `messageId`. The projection applies to the session's own frames only: `subagent_event` payloads forwarded under `set_subagent_subscription` level `"events"` keep their full `message_update` snapshots.

Each command replaces the whole filter state: omitting `messageUpdates` resets it to `"full"`, the default, which retains the original full snapshots. An invalid `events` shape (anything other than `null` or an array of non-empty strings), or a mode other than `"full"` or `"delta"`, returns an error without changing either setting. Event names are not checked against a fixed catalog; unknown non-empty names are accepted. Projection works in protocol v1 and v2, including with `events: null`. Detect support from the echoed `data.messageUpdates` field: older servers ignore the option and do not echo it. This opt-in is raw-protocol only; the TypeScript `RpcClient` and Python client keep their full-message listener contracts.

`agent_end` has this session-level shape (in addition to optional telemetry fields):

```ts
{
  type: "agent_end";
  messages: AgentMessage[];
  isTerminal?: boolean;
  yielded?: boolean;
  awaitingAsyncWork?: boolean;
}
```

`yielded` is `true` when the agent finished its turn: the end is terminal, or the session resumes only for queued input or background-job results. It is `false` while the agent continues its own work (retry, compaction continuation, stop-time reminders). Frames from older runtimes omit it; treat those as yielded only when terminal.

`isTerminal: false` means a continuation or possible async delivery remains.
`awaitingAsyncWork: true` identifies a non-terminal end whose only possible
resume is a background-job result; cancelled or suppressed delivery may mean
no follow-up run occurs. The optional fields keep older frames terminal-compatible
when `isTerminal` is absent. Use `yielded` for a prompt's yield and
`session_settled` for quiescence, rather than assuming every non-terminal end
guarantees another turn.

### Cache warming events

Each refresh handed to the provider stream emits one start and one matching end
(a session disposed mid-refresh emits no end).
Warm-or-stop decisions that do not send a request emit neither. These are
session events, so **both types must be listed in `set_event_filter` when a filter
is active** to observe complete refresh lifecycles:

```ts
{
  type: "cache_warming_start";
  phase: "streaming" | "idle";
  provider: string;
  model: string; // model id
}
{
  type: "cache_warming_end";
  phase: "streaming" | "idle"; // same phase as the matching start
  provider: string;
  model: string;
  outcome: "hit" | "miss" | "error" | "aborted";
  usage?: Usage;
  warmingStopReason?: string;
}
```

- `hit`: the refresh read cached tokens without writing a new cache entry.
- `miss`: it read no cached tokens or wrote cache tokens; warming stops.
- `error`: no response was available or the response reported an error; warming stops.
- `aborted`: the run was cancelled or replaced while the refresh was in flight.

`usage` is present only when the refresh was recorded as a `model_usage` entry
(`purpose: "cache-warm"`, or `"cache-warm:extension-override"` when an extension
forced it). This includes paid misses, errors, and `aborted` refreshes the
provider had already accepted (usage reported before the cancellation); an
abort before the provider responded has no usage. Summing `usage.cost.total`
attributes the warming costs already included in `get_session_stats`, rather
than adding another charge.

These events are ordinary session events, so `--mode json` output includes them
as well.

`warmingStopReason` explains why warming stopped because of or during the
refresh, for example `"refresh missed the cache"`, `"refresh failed"`,
`"cache warming disabled"`, or `"conversation context changed"`. It is absent
when warming continues: the refresh rescheduled, or a new request replaced the
run.

### Available commands

`get_available_commands` returns `{ commands }`, and the same array is pushed
in `available_commands_update` frames at startup and after command metadata
changes. Each command has `name`, `source`, and optional `aliases`,
`description`, `input.hint`, and `subcommands`.

Command discovery is intentionally an OMP dialect: Pi's `get_commands` (a
`RpcSlashCommand[]` projection over extensions → prompt templates → skills) is
not served because OMP's richer catalog (builtins/custom/MCP/file commands,
broader `source` enum, no Pi `sourceInfo`) is not wire-compatible with it.

### Pi-compatible history/tree commands with OMP-native entry payloads

The commands and reconciliation semantics below are Pi-compatible, but the
returned `SessionEntry` payload union is OMP-native, not wire-identical to
Pi. Concretely: Pi `model_change` carries `provider` + `modelId` while OMP
carries a combined `model` plus role/fallback metadata; Pi uses a `usage`
entry where OMP uses `model_usage`; and OMP has additional entry types (for
example service-tier, title, mode, credential, and reset records). A
permissive client that consumes the common structural subset
(`id`/`parentId` plus message entries) can share one durable-history
algorithm across both, while a strict Pi `SessionEntry` decoder cannot assume
identical payloads.

`get_entries` reads the canonical append-history (not the active branch only)
and returns `{ entries, leafId }`. Without `since` it returns all entries in
append order; with `since` it returns entries strictly after the matching
durable entry id. An unknown `since` fails explicitly with
`code: "unknown_since"`. `get_tree` returns the raw session tree as
`{ tree, leafId }` straight from `SessionManager`, not a UI projection.

`get_available_thinking_levels` returns `{ levels }`: the selectable levels
for the live model with `"off"` first (it is accepted by
`set_thinking_level` but excluded from the effort-only model helper). OMP-only
`auto`/`inherit` selectors are intentionally omitted from discovery.

Lifecycle stays OMP: `agent_end` carries `isTerminal`, `yielded`, and optional
`awaitingAsyncWork`; `prompt_result` correlates prompt completion and
`session_settled` reports quiescence. There is no Pi `agent_settled` frame.
These, `agentInvoked`, `open_session`, `set_event_filter`, `messageId`, `ready`,
negotiation, chunking, host tools, and subagents are OMP extensions a
Pi-family adapter must dialect around.

### Subagent subscriptions

Subagent forwarding defaults to `"off"`. `set_subagent_subscription` selects:

- `"off"`: no forwarded subagent frames
- `"progress"`: lifecycle and progress frames
- `"events"`: lifecycle, progress, and full subagent event frames

`get_subagents` returns the registry snapshot sorted by subagent index and id.
`get_subagent_messages` selects a transcript by `subagentId` or a registered
`sessionFile` (`subagentId` takes precedence); arbitrary file paths are rejected.
`fromByte` supports incremental reads, defaults to zero, and is clamped to a
non-negative integer. Non-finite values fail. The result contains `sessionFile`,
`fromByte`, `nextByte`, `reset`, raw transcript `entries`, and `messages` from
message entries. Only complete newline-terminated records are consumed; reuse
`nextByte` on the next request. A missing transcript returns empty arrays.
If `fromByte` exceeds the current file size, reading restarts at byte zero and
reports `reset: true`.

### Cancelling subagents

`cancel_subagent` hard-kills one subagent currently listed by `get_subagents`
(foreground or background, at any nesting depth) without aborting the parent
turn. It uses the same path as the Agent Hub kill: the subagent's live turn is
aborted and its registry entry becomes an `aborted` tombstone, so the owning
`task` call settles with an aborted result and the subagent cannot be revived.
When `set_subagent_subscription` is `"progress"` or `"events"`, a
`subagent_lifecycle` frame with `status: "aborted"` follows.

```json
{ "id": "req_1", "type": "cancel_subagent", "subagentId": "OmpWorker" }
{ "id": "req_1", "type": "response", "command": "cancel_subagent", "success": true, "data": { "cancelled": true } }
```

`cancelled` is `false` when the id is not a running subagent of this session:
unknown, another session's same-name agent, finished (including a subagent
whose result the parent already accepted, even before its terminal lifecycle
frame), or already cancelled, so hosts can treat it as idempotent. If the
`aborted` tombstone cannot be persisted, the subagent is still aborted and
disposed, and the command returns an error response with the write failure.

### Steering subagents

`steer_subagent` sends a message to a running subagent as its user, the same
way Agent Hub chat does: a mid-turn subagent is steered at its next step
boundary, and one between turns starts its next turn. The message is recorded
in the subagent's own transcript; it is not attributed to the parent agent,
and the parent sees only the subagent's eventual result. Isolated (worktree)
subagents run in-process and are steered the same way.

```json
{ "id": "req_1", "type": "steer_subagent", "subagentId": "OmpWorker", "message": "Drop the glob, keep the direct path." }
{ "id": "req_1", "type": "response", "command": "steer_subagent", "success": true }
```

The response arrives once the message is accepted: queued into the running
turn, or the subagent's new turn started. It does not wait for the turn to
finish. Like `prompt`, the command starts in queue order but waits for
acceptance in the background, so later commands (including `abort`) are not
held behind it. As in Agent Hub chat (not RPC `steer`), the message goes
through the subagent's `prompt()`: extension, custom and file slash commands
run and prompt templates expand.

Failure responses:

- missing/empty `subagentId` or blank `message` → validation error
- `subagentId` not currently listed as running by `get_subagents` (unknown,
  finished, already cancelled, another session's agent, or one whose result
  the parent already accepted) → `error: "Subagent not running: <id>"`
- the subagent drops or rejects the message before accepting it (for example
  an abort or a usage-limit preflight denial lands first) →
  `error: "Subagent refused the message: <reason>"`

## Prompt/Queue Concurrency and Ordering

Ordinary commands run on a serialized queue. Extension UI responses and host
tool/URI updates/results bypass that queue, so they can complete a request
while its command handler is waiting. `bash` also bypasses the serial queue and
is tracked as background command work; its response may arrive out of order.
`prompt` and `steer_subagent` start in queue order but await admission in the
background, so their responses may also arrive after later commands'.

### Immediate ack vs completion

Ordinary `prompt` requests are **acknowledged without waiting for the agent run**;
`abort_and_prompt` first waits for the abort. Builtin slash-command handlers and
skill-file loading can delay acknowledgement:

```json
{ "id": "req_1", "type": "response", "command": "prompt", "success": true }
```

That means:

- command acceptance != run completion
- a prompt completes via `data.agentInvoked: false` on its response or via its own `prompt_result`
- a run completes on an `agent_end` frame where `isTerminal !== false`; that frame carries no prompt identity, so correlate prompts through `prompt_result`
- native `input` handlers run once, in submission order, before command, skill, or queue dispatch. Later input waits until the earlier submission is admitted, including an idle skill's vision description, and does not wait for its model turn. An `abort` cancels input received before it that is not yet admitted, even if that input is still in a hook. A successful `new_session`, `switch_session`, `branch`, `fork` or `open_session` does the same for input received before it; a vetoed one cancels nothing, and input sent after the session change runs in the new session.
- the session is done only at `session_settled`: background jobs can wake the agent after it yields

### While streaming

`AgentSession.prompt()` requires `streamingBehavior` during active streaming:

- `"steer"` => queued steering message (interrupt path)
- `"followUp"` => queued follow-up message (post-turn path)

If omitted during streaming, prompt fails.

Providers supporting live steering may consume queued steering during the
streaming response; otherwise it is delivered at a turn/tool-batch boundary.
`follow_up` waits until the agent would otherwise stop.

### Queue defaults

From `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/settings.ts` (also the core `Agent` defaults):

- `steeringMode`: `"one-at-a-time"`
- `followUpMode`: `"one-at-a-time"`
- `interruptMode`: `"immediate"`

CLI settings can change these initial values. `set_steering_mode`,
`set_follow_up_mode`, and `set_interrupt_mode` affect the calling session only;
they do not write global `config.yml`. `set_auto_compaction` and
`set_auto_retry` likewise use session-scoped settings overrides.

### Mode semantics

- `set_steering_mode` / `set_follow_up_mode`
  - `"one-at-a-time"`: dequeue one delivery group per queue drain, keeping hidden companions with their user message
  - `"all"`: dequeue the entire queue at once
- `set_interrupt_mode`
  - `"immediate"`: queued steering raises a cooperative signal for foreground tools, allowing auto-backgroundable work to step aside; it does not hard-kill or skip non-interruptible tools
  - `"wait"`: omit that cooperative steering signal and let side-effecting work finish before injecting steering at the tool-batch boundary
  - In both modes, interruptible waits are cancelled or skipped when steering arrives. This setting is not equivalent to `abort`.

## Extension UI Sub-Protocol

Extensions in RPC mode use request/response UI frames. `--no-ui` disables the extension runner's UI in both RPC modes: extensions see `ctx.hasUI === false`, dialogs resolve to their defaults without emitting frames, and presentation updates (`notify`, `setStatus`, `setWidget`, `setTitle`, `set_editor_text`) are dropped.

`--mode rpc-ui` independently enables the tool UI context, including with `--no-ui`:

- `ask` still sends `select` requests. Free-text answers use `editor` with `promptStyle: true`; `ask` does not send `input` requests. Dialog cancellation can send `cancel`.
- Other callers using the tool UI context retain its supported dialog methods (`select`, `confirm`, `input`, `editor`, and cancellation) and presentation methods (`notify`, `setStatus`, string-array `setWidget`, `set_editor_text`, and opt-in `setTitle`). `--no-ui` is not a transport-level filter on these methods.
- Tool approval prompts use the extension runner, not the tool UI context. Under `--no-ui`, tools requiring approval fail closed with a no-interactive-UI error rather than sending an approval dialog, just as with `--mode rpc --no-ui`.
- MCP authentication challenges do not gain an RPC UI handler in either mode; the interactive-mode MCP auth handler is not installed.
- A host-issued `login` is independent of both UI settings: it can emit `open_url`, progress `notify`, and non-secret `input` requests after the authorization URL. Secret input and prompts before an authorization URL remain unsupported.

Use `--mode rpc --no-ui` for a host without a tool UI surface; use `--mode rpc-ui --no-ui` to answer tool dialogs while keeping extensions headless. Plain `--mode rpc-ui` enables both extension and tool UI.

### Outbound request

`RpcExtensionUIRequest` (`type: "extension_ui_request"`) methods:

- `select`, `confirm`, `input`, `editor`, `ask`, `cancel`
  - `select` keeps labels in `options: string[]` and, when any option has a
    description, emits a positionally aligned
    `optionDetails: Array<{ description?: string }>` array. Hosts that do not
    render descriptions can continue using `options` alone.
  - `ask` is emitted only after `set_ask_dialog` enables it. It carries every
    question of one `ask` tool call:
    `questions: Array<{ id: string, question: string, header?: string, options: Array<{ label: string, description?: string, preview?: string }>, multi?: boolean, recommended?: number }>`
    plus `timeout?: number`. `options` never include an "Other" entry; hosts
    always offer free text.
- `notify`, `setStatus`, `setWidget`, `setTitle`, `set_editor_text`
- `open_url` (emitted by RPC login flows): includes `url`, optional `launchUrl`, and optional `instructions`. When present, `launchUrl` is a short loopback redirect and is the recommended copy target so terminal truncation cannot corrupt OAuth query parameters.

Runtime note:

- Automatic session title generation is disabled in RPC mode, and `setTitle` UI
  requests are also suppressed by default because most hosts do not have a
  meaningful terminal-title surface. Set `PI_RPC_EMIT_TITLE=1` to opt back in to
  the UI event only.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "extension_ui_request",
  "id": "123",
  "method": "confirm",
  "title": "Confirm",
  "message": "Continue?",
  "timeout": 30000
}
```

### Inbound response

`RpcExtensionUIResponse` (`type: "extension_ui_response"`):

- `{ type: "extension_ui_response", id: string, value: string }`
- `{ type: "extension_ui_response", id: string, confirmed: boolean }`
- `{ type: "extension_ui_response", id: string, cancelled: true, timedOut?: boolean }`
- `{ type: "extension_ui_response", id: string, answers: Array<{ id: string, selectedOptions: string[], customInput?: string }> }` (answers an `ask` request)

`select` and `input` resolve to `undefined`, and `confirm` to `false`, on
cancellation, timeout, or signal abort. Signal abort emits a `cancel` request
with `targetId`. `editor` supports cancellation and signal abort but has no wire timeout.
Presentation methods and `open_url` are fire-and-forget and require no response.

If a dialog has a timeout, RPC mode resolves to a default value when timeout/abort fires, and emits
`{ method: "cancel", targetId }` so the host closes the dialog; a later answer to it is ignored. For `ask`, a timeout
(omp's timer or a host `cancelled: true, timedOut: true` reply) answers every question with its recommended
option, else its first.

`answers` must list one entry per question in request order, with each `id` equal to that question's `id`.
`selectedOptions` holds exact option labels without duplicates; a multi-select may be empty. A single-select
(`multi` absent or false) takes at most one option and not both an option and `customInput`. `customInput`
is trimmed and ignored when empty. Any other shape fails the `ask` tool call instead of guessing.

```json
{
  "type": "extension_ui_request",
  "id": "ui_9",
  "method": "ask",
  "questions": [
    { "id": "db", "question": "Which database?", "options": [{ "label": "Postgres" }, { "label": "SQLite" }], "recommended": 1 },
    { "id": "features", "question": "Which features?", "options": [{ "label": "Auth" }, { "label": "Billing" }, { "label": "Search" }], "multi": true }
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "extension_ui_response",
  "id": "ui_9",
  "answers": [
    { "id": "db", "selectedOptions": [], "customInput": "DuckDB" },
    { "id": "features", "selectedOptions": ["Auth", "Search"] }
  ]
}
```

Terminal-only UI features are unsupported: component factories, custom
headers/footers/editors, raw terminal input, autocomplete composition, theme
switching, and tool expansion. `getEditorText()` returns `""`;
`pasteToEditor()` falls back to `set_editor_text`.

## Host Tool Sub-Protocol

RPC hosts can expose custom tools to the agent by sending `set_host_tools`, then
serving execution requests over the same transport.

### Outbound request

When the agent wants the host to execute one of those tools, RPC mode emits:

```json
{
  "type": "host_tool_call",
  "id": "host_1",
  "toolCallId": "toolu_123",
  "toolName": "echo_host",
  "arguments": { "message": "hello" }
}
```

If the tool execution is later aborted, RPC mode emits:

```json
{
  "type": "host_tool_cancel",
  "id": "host_cancel_1",
  "targetId": "host_1"
}
```

### Inbound updates and completion

Hosts can optionally stream progress:

```json
{
  "type": "host_tool_update",
  "id": "host_1",
  "partialResult": {
    "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "working" }]
  }
}
```

Completion uses:

```json
{
  "type": "host_tool_result",
  "id": "host_1",
  "result": {
    "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "done" }]
  }
}
```

Set top-level `isError: true` on `host_tool_result` to reject the pending host tool call and surface the returned text content as a tool error.

## Live Voice Sub-Protocol

RPC hosts can run a GPT live voice session (the realtime surface behind the
terminal's `/live`) bound to the RPC session. The realtime model talks to the
user through the machine's microphone and speakers and delegates work into the
RPC session as ordinary turns, so delegated work runs with the session's model
and any host tools registered through `set_host_tools`. At most one live
session runs per RPC server.

### Commands

- `{ id?, type: "live_start", voice?: string, instructions?: string }` → `data: { voice: string }`
- `{ id?, type: "live_stop" }`
- `{ id?, type: "live_mute", muted?: boolean }` → `data: { muted: boolean }`

`live_start` responds once the session is connected and recording, so it is
dispatched concurrently like `bash`; `live_stop` sent meanwhile cancels the
connection and the pending `live_start` then fails. `voice` defaults to the
`live.voice` setting and the response reports the voice used. `instructions`
replaces the bundled live prompt; it is rendered as a Handlebars template with
`{{username}}` and `{{firstName}}` of the local OS account. Starting while a
session is connecting, active, or closing fails.

`live_stop` responds after the session has stopped and succeeds when none is
active. `live_mute` sets the microphone mute, or toggles it when `muted` is
omitted, and fails when no session is active.

```json
{ "id": "l1", "type": "live_start", "instructions": "You are Carly. Greet {{firstName}}." }
{ "id": "l1", "type": "response", "command": "live_start", "success": true, "data": { "voice": "sol" } }
```

### Frames

Live frames are not session events: `set_event_filter` never drops them.

- `{ type: "live_phase", phase }` on every phase change; `phase` is one of `connecting`, `listening`, `working`, `speaking`, `muted`, `error`.
- `{ type: "live_levels", input: number, output: number }` — microphone and speaker RMS in `[0, 1]`, at most one frame per 100 ms. Intermediate values are dropped; the latest values are always delivered.
- `{ type: "live_transcript", role: "user" | "assistant", turn: number, text: string, final: boolean }` — the accumulated text of one turn; later frames for the same `role` and `turn` replace earlier ones until `final: true`.
- `{ type: "live_end", error?: string }` — exactly once per session when it ends, carrying the failure when it ended on one (including a failed `live_start`).

Closing stdin, or `pi.shutdown()`, stops an active live session before the
process exits.

## Host URI Sub-Protocol

RPC hosts can also own custom URL schemes (virtual files). After
`set_host_uri_schemes`, every read of `<scheme>://…` and write of
`<scheme>://…` (when registered as `writable`) is bounced back to the host
over the same transport.

### Outbound request

When a session tool resolves a host-owned URL, RPC mode emits:

```json
{
  "type": "host_uri_request",
  "id": "uri_1",
  "operation": "read",
  "url": "db://users/42"
}
```

Writes look the same with `"operation": "write"` and an additional
`"content": "..."` field carrying the full replacement text.

If the request is later aborted (caller cancels, session ends), RPC mode
emits:

```json
{
  "type": "host_uri_cancel",
  "id": "uri_cancel_1",
  "targetId": "uri_1"
}
```

### Inbound result

For successful reads:

```json
{
  "type": "host_uri_result",
  "id": "uri_1",
  "content": "id=42\nname=Alice\n",
  "contentType": "text/plain",
  "notes": ["fresh from cache"],
  "immutable": false
}
```

For successful writes, omit content:

```json
{ "type": "host_uri_result", "id": "uri_1" }
```

To reject the request, set `isError: true` and either populate `error` with
a message or fall back to `content` for textual error surfacing:

```json
{
  "type": "host_uri_result",
  "id": "uri_1",
  "isError": true,
  "error": "row 42 not found"
}
```

### Constraints

- The agent's `edit` tool does not target host URIs. Hosts that want to
  mutate virtual files expose `write` and let the model use the `write` tool
  with replacement content.
- Schemes are global to the process; `set_host_uri_schemes` replaces the
  previous set, unregistering anything not in the new list.
- Schemes are normalized to lowercase before registration.
- Send `content` for successful reads; the current bridge treats an omitted
  value as an empty string. `contentType` defaults to `text/plain` and its
  declared values are `"text/plain"`, `"text/markdown"`, or `"application/json"`.
  A result-level `immutable` overrides the registered scheme's value for that read.

## Error Model and Recoverability

### Command-level failures

Failures are `success: false` with string `error`.

```json
{
  "id": "req_2",
  "type": "response",
  "command": "set_model",
  "success": false,
  "error": "Model not found: provider/model"
}
```

### Recoverability expectations

- Most command failures are recoverable; process remains alive.
- Malformed JSONL / parse-loop exceptions emit a `parse` error response and continue reading subsequent lines.
- Empty `set_session_name` is rejected (`Session name cannot be empty`).
- Extension UI responses and valid host-tool/host-URI updates/results with unknown `id` are ignored. These side-channel frames do not receive command response frames.
- Normal termination occurs on stdin close or extension-triggered shutdown. Output/spool failures and unrecovered session-persistence failures are fatal.
- Session-persistence errors emit an unfiltered `{ type: "notice", level: "error", message, source: "session-persistence" }` frame and a stderr mirror. A recovered failure can still shut down normally; a failure still latched during disposal exits with code `1` after draining stdout.

## Compact Command Flows

### 1) Prompt and stream

stdin:

```json
{ "id": "req_1", "type": "prompt", "message": "Summarize this repo" }
```

stdout sequence (simplified; message contents omitted):

```json
{ "id": "req_1", "type": "response", "command": "prompt", "success": true }
{ "type": "agent_start" }
{ "type": "message_update", "messageId": "msg-2", "assistantMessageEvent": { "type": "text_delta", "delta": "..." }, "message": { "role": "assistant", "content": [] } }
{ "type": "agent_end", "messages": [], "isTerminal": true, "yielded": true }
{ "type": "prompt_result", "id": "req_1", "agentInvoked": true, "status": "completed", "sessionSettled": true }
{ "type": "session_settled" }
```

### 2) Prompt during streaming with explicit queue policy

stdin:

```json
{
  "id": "req_2",
  "type": "prompt",
  "message": "Also include risks",
  "streamingBehavior": "followUp"
}
```

### 3) Inspect and tune queue behavior

stdin:

```json
{ "id": "q1", "type": "get_state" }
{ "id": "q2", "type": "set_steering_mode", "mode": "all" }
{ "id": "q3", "type": "set_interrupt_mode", "mode": "wait" }
```

### 4) Extension UI round trip

stdout:

```json
{
  "type": "extension_ui_request",
  "id": "ui_7",
  "method": "input",
  "title": "Branch name",
  "placeholder": "feature/..."
}
```

stdin:

```json
{ "type": "extension_ui_response", "id": "ui_7", "value": "feature/rpc-host" }
```

## Client libraries

### Wire schema and generated clients

`packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/wire` describes every command (parameters,
success `data`, nullability, timeouts), every unsolicited frame, and every shared
type as omptype schemas. `bun run gen:rpc` emits:

- `rpc-wire.schema.json`: a JSON Schema 2020-12 bundle plus an `x-rpc` section:
  the command table, the stdout frame union (`serverFrame`: responses, host
  requests, notifications), the notification and session-event unions, and the
  host-to-server frame union (`inbound`). It is the language-neutral input for
  client generators, with these decoder rules:
  - objects marked `"x-open": true` are open records (messages, content, usage,
    assistant streaming events): decoders check the `role`/`type` discriminator
    and keep every key, so persisted messages missing newer fields still decode;
  - a property `default` is the value decoders substitute when an older server
    omits the field;
  - string enums are closed: an unknown value fails the frame, which clients then
    surface as an unknown notification instead of stopping;
  - `x-unknown-fallback` on a property (a subagent's forwarded event) degrades a
    value that fails to decode to an unknown notification without failing its
    frame, and `x-scalar-or-array` marks an array older servers sent as a bare
    scalar.
- `rpc-wire.generated.ts`: the wire types in TypeScript.
- `sdk/python/omp-rpc/src/omp_rpc/_wire.py`: Python types, decoders, command methods,
  and frame listeners for the `omp-rpc` package.
- `sdk/rust/omp-rpc/src/wire.rs`: Rust serde types, frame decoders, and a `Command`
  trait implemented by one params struct per command (crate `omp-rpc`).
- `sdk/go/omp-rpc/wire.go`: Go types, frame decoders, and one `Commands` method per
  command (module `github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/sdk/go/omp-rpc`).

The Rust and Go packages ship hand-written process transports on top of the
generated types: they negotiate v2 and reassemble chunks, page message history,
wait for a prompt's `prompt_result` (`prompt_and_wait` / `PromptAndWait`), and serve
host-owned tools and URI schemes. Their READMEs cover the APIs.

`packages/coding-agent/test/rpc-wire` fails when a committed output is stale, and
type-checks the generated TypeScript against `rpc-types.ts` and the internal types
behind it: a new command, command parameter, event, event field, or enum value on
the server breaks `bun check` until the schema covers it.

### TypeScript helper

`packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/rpc-client.ts` is a convenience wrapper, not the protocol definition.

Current helper characteristics:

- Spawns `bun <cliPath> --mode rpc` by default (`cliPath` defaults to `dist/cli.js`). A `command` argv prefix receives generated agent arguments; a command builder returns complete argv. A custom `spawn` transport takes precedence.
- Correlates responses by generated `req_<n>` ids, negotiates v2, reassembles chunks, and pages message history
- Dispatches recognized core `AgentEvent` types through `onEvent()` and recognized session events through `onSessionEvent()`; the raw server stream can include additional event types
- Exposes `onPromptResult()`, `onSessionSettled()`, command-availability and subagent listeners, plus extension UI requests
- Supports host-owned custom tools via `setCustomTools()` and automatic handling of `host_tool_call` / `host_tool_cancel`
- Drives live voice sessions with `liveStart()`, `liveStop()`, `liveMute()`, and delivers live frames through `onLive()`
- `promptAndWait()` waits for that prompt's result (or synchronous local completion); `waitForSettled()` also waits for session quiescence. `waitForIdle()` and `collectEvents()` stop at the next `agent_end`, including a non-terminal one, and are not settle barriers.
- Wraps common protocol commands including OAuth `getLoginProviders()` / `login(...)`; use raw protocol frames for unwrapped surfaces such as host-URI registration or delta-only message updates.

### Python package

The bundled [`omp-rpc`](../sdk/python/omp-rpc/pyproject.toml) distribution provides the process-backed Python client. Its import package is `omp_rpc`; the package API, typed commands and events, host-tool/host-URI helpers, and orchestration examples are maintained in the [`omp-rpc` README](../sdk/python/omp-rpc/README.md).

```python
from omp_rpc import RpcClient

with RpcClient(provider="anthropic", model="claude-sonnet-4-5") as client:
    state = client.get_state()
    turn = client.prompt_and_wait("Reply with just the word hello")
    print(turn.require_assistant_text())
```

By default, `RpcClient` starts `omp --mode rpc`; pass `command=[...]` to own the exact child command. It handles request correlation, typed notifications, v2 negotiation and chunk reassembly, message pagination, extension UI (including the opt-in `ask` dialog), and host-owned tools and URI schemes. Its command methods and `on_<frame type>` listeners are generated from the wire schema, so it wraps every command above; the `messageUpdates: "delta"` projection stays raw-protocol only. The Python package owns that client API and process lifecycle; this document and `rpc-types.ts` remain the canonical wire contract. Use raw protocol frames when a client library does not wrap the surface you need.

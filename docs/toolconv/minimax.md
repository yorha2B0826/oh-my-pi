# MiniMax owned tool-calling format (`<minimax:tool_call>`)

OMP's `minimax` dialect is the prompt-driven, in-band tool protocol for MiniMax-family models. Calls are ordinary assistant text: one `<minimax:tool_call>` envelope contains one or more `<invoke>` elements. OMP executes the parsed calls and returns a `<function_results>` block in the next user turn. The format carries no tool-call ids, so calls and results are correlated by order.

This reference describes OMP's implemented converter, not MiniMax's provider-native structured tool API. It is verified against `packages/ai/src/dialect/minimax.ts`, the shared XML scanner in `packages/ai/src/dialect/anthropic.ts`, prompt assembly in `packages/ai/src/dialect/catalog.ts`, and the streaming projection in `packages/ai/src/dialect/owned-stream.ts`.

## Selection and request conversion

Set the format explicitly in `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` or a project/overlay config:

```yaml
tools:
  format: minimax
```

`tools.format: minimax` forces this owned dialect for the session. In `auto` mode, OMP keeps provider-native tool calling unless the selected model explicitly has `supportsTools: false`; for a MiniMax-family model id, that fallback resolves to `minimax`. See [`tools.format`](../settings.md#tools-and-approvals).

`PI_DIALECT=minimax` also selects it when configuration resolves to no owned
dialect. Unset that environment variable when choosing `native`: the agent
uses it as a fallback even when `tools.format` resolves to native tools.
Dialect resolution runs for each provider request.

With an owned dialect and a non-empty tool list, OMP:

1. removes the native structured `tools` field and tool choice from the provider request;
2. appends an in-band tool catalog and the MiniMax format guide to the system prompt;
3. rewrites prior structured assistant calls and tool-result messages into this text protocol; and
4. scans the model's text stream back into structured tool-call events.

## Tool definitions and prompt injection

The injected prompt begins with `# Tools`, says calls are text rather than native provider tool messages, and lists the available functions inside `<tools></tools>`. Each line is a compact OpenAI-style function object containing the normalized wire schema:

```text
<tools>
{"type":"function","function":{"name":"read","description":"Read a file","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"count":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path"]}}}
</tools>
```

The catalog is followed by the MiniMax-specific guide from `packages/ai/src/dialect/minimax.md`. Its contract requires a listed function name, literal string/scalar bodies, JSON lists/objects, one envelope for a batch, and no model-authored result blocks.

## Tool-call envelope

A single call is:

```text
<minimax:tool_call>
<invoke name="read"><parameter name="path">src/main.ts</parameter><parameter name="count">40</parameter></invoke>
</minimax:tool_call>
```

Exact structure:

| Element | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `<minimax:tool_call>…</minimax:tool_call>` | Required model-output envelope in the prompt contract. |
| `<invoke name="TOOL">…</invoke>` | One call. `name` must be a listed tool. |
| `<parameter name="ARG">VALUE</parameter>` | One named argument. Arguments occur directly inside the invoke. |

The renderer XML-escapes tool and argument names in attributes. Parameter bodies are deliberately **not** XML-escaped: this protocol is delimiter-matched rather than parsed as XML. For example, a string body is `a & b < c`, not `a &amp; b &lt; c`. A literal `</parameter>` is the one reserved sequence because it closes that argument.

The scanner is more tolerant than the prompt contract. It accepts the namespaced wrapper above, an unprefixed `<tool_call>` wrapper, or a bare `<invoke>` outside a wrapper. Models should still emit the canonical `<minimax:tool_call>` form so behavior does not depend on recovery paths.

## Argument encoding and coercion

Encoding uses the selected tool's schema:

| Declared/value kind | Rendered parameter body | Parsed value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Schema-declared string whose runtime value is a string | Verbatim text, including leading/trailing spaces and newlines | Verbatim string |
| Non-string runtime value for a schema-treated string argument | JSON | That JSON text retained as a string |
| Argument not treated as a string | JSON, including quotes around runtime strings | Parsed JSON when valid |

Example:

```text
<invoke name="write"><parameter name="path">notes/a & b.txt</parameter><parameter name="options">{"append":false,"tags":["x","y"]}</parameter></invoke>
```

The scanner resolves string arguments from the supplied tool schemas or an explicit `stringArgs` callback. A string-only schema remains a string schema when nullable; enums, constants, and union branches also contribute to type detection. A parameter attribute can override that decision:

- `string="true"` (and any value except `false`, `0`, or `no`) forces verbatim string handling.
- `string="false"`, `string="0"`, or `string="no"` forces JSON parsing even for a schema-declared string.

For a non-string parameter, surrounding whitespace is trimmed only for the JSON parse. OMP uses its repair-capable JSON parser; if parsing still fails, the original body is retained as a string rather than dropping the argument. Empty bodies also remain empty strings. A parameter with no usable `name` is ignored.

The scanner does not validate tool membership or the full argument schema.
Repeated parameter names overwrite earlier values at call completion. Attribute
values are not entity-decoded; the delimiter parser is not an XML round trip
for tool/argument names containing characters that require entity escaping.

## Multiple and parallel calls

Parallel calls are sibling `<invoke>` elements inside one envelope, in emitted order:

```text
<minimax:tool_call>
<invoke name="read"><parameter name="path">src/a.ts</parameter></invoke>
<invoke name="read"><parameter name="path">src/b.ts</parameter></invoke>
</minimax:tool_call>
```

The scanner mints an internal id for each invoke because the wire format has no id. OMP can dispatch the resulting calls as a batch. Tool results must be returned in the same order; the result protocol has no call id with which to repair reordering.

## Tool-result envelope

OMP batches consecutive tool results into one `<function_results>` block. Success and failure use different records:

```text
<function_results>
<result>
<tool_name>read</tool_name>
<stdout>file contents</stdout>
</result>
<error>
<tool_name>read</tool_name>
<stderr>ENOENT: file not found</stderr>
</error>
</function_results>
```

For every result:

- success is `<result>` with `<stdout>`;
- `isError: true` is `<error>` with `<stderr>`;
- `<tool_name>` is XML-text escaped;
- stdout/stderr is inserted verbatim; and
- there is no call id, so the model reads records in call order.

OMP places this text in a synthesized `user` message. Text blocks from one tool result are concatenated; image result blocks remain image blocks after the rendered text. The model must never emit `<function_results>` or `<tool_response>` itself.

## Thinking and visible text

OMP renders a preserved reasoning block as:

```text
<thinking>
reasoning text
</thinking>
```

`renderThinking` and the direct transcript renderer preserve reasoning in this
form. When the input consists entirely of complete `<thinking>` wrappers,
nested/adjacent wrappers are flattened before adding the delimiter pair.
Normal history conversion of a call-bearing assistant message keeps only prose
and rendered calls, dropping its original thinking blocks.

In the normal owned-tool stream, thinking parsing is enabled. The MiniMax
scanner recognizes `<thinking>`, `<think>`, and `<scratchpad>` (including
supported prefixed forms), emits separate thinking events, and keeps the
content out of visible text. A direct scanner defaults to thinking parsing
disabled; outside call wrappers those tags then remain visible text. Non-call
text inside a wrapper is discarded. An unterminated thinking block is closed
logically on flush and retains its accumulated content.

Visible prose may precede the tool envelope. Text outside calls remains assistant text; non-call text inside the wrapper is discarded by the scanner.

## Streaming, malformed output, and recovery

The scanner is incremental and chunk-boundary safe: opening/closing tags and parameter bodies may arrive in separate provider deltas. Its observable lifecycle is:

1. a non-empty `<invoke name="…">` emits `toolStart` immediately;
2. each named parameter body emits keyed `toolArgDelta` events as text chunks arrive; and
3. the matching `</invoke>` performs final coercion and emits `toolEnd` with the complete arguments and exact raw invoke block.

Important failure behavior:

- **Missing call name:** no tool lifecycle is emitted for that invoke.
- **Missing parameter name:** that parameter is ignored.
- **Malformed JSON:** falls back to the original parameter text.
- **Very large parameter:** the retained parameter value and its argument deltas are capped at 1,000,000 JavaScript string code units; the completed value gets an explicit truncation marker on overflow. The diagnostic `rawBlock` still retains the full invoke, so this is not a cap on total input or raw capture.
- **Incomplete invoke:** flush resets scanner-local call state and emits no `toolEnd`. However, OMP's stream projector has already materialized a call from `toolStart`; on a normally stopped response it retains that partial call, marks the turn as tool use, and may dispatch it. Already streamed argument text remains uncoerced, and a call with no argument text has `{}`. A provider `length` stop remains `length` rather than becoming runnable tool use.
- **Incomplete wrapper after complete invokes:** already closed invokes remain valid; the wrapper close is not required to emit their `toolEnd` events.
- **Incomplete thinking:** retained as thinking and logically ended at flush.

OMP also guards against a model fabricating tool output after its call. For this dialect, the first `<function_results>` or `<tool_response>` boundary stops projection. With the default `tools.abortOnFabricatedResult: true`, generation is aborted immediately; when disabled, OMP drains the provider stream but discards the fabricated continuation.

If the provider emits native structured calls despite owned mode, the first
named native or in-band call selects the channel for that turn. Calls from the
other channel are discarded to avoid double dispatch.

## End-to-end example

Injected tool definition (abbreviated to the relevant catalog line):

```text
<tools>
{"type":"function","function":{"name":"get_weather","description":"Get weather","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"city":{"type":"string"},"units":{"type":"string"}},"required":["city"]}}}
</tools>
```

Assistant call:

```text
I'll check both cities.
<minimax:tool_call>
<invoke name="get_weather"><parameter name="city">Tokyo</parameter><parameter name="units">celsius</parameter></invoke>
<invoke name="get_weather"><parameter name="city">Oslo</parameter><parameter name="units">celsius</parameter></invoke>
</minimax:tool_call>
```

Next user turn produced by OMP:

```text
<function_results>
<result>
<tool_name>get_weather</tool_name>
<stdout>{"temperature":28,"condition":"clear"}</stdout>
</result>
<result>
<tool_name>get_weather</tool_name>
<stdout>{"temperature":14,"condition":"rain"}</stdout>
</result>
</function_results>
```

The assistant can then answer normally or emit another complete MiniMax call envelope.

## Parsing notes and gotchas

- **Not real XML.** Do not entity-escape parameter bodies or run them through an XML DOM parser; matching is based on protocol delimiters.
- **One envelope, many invokes.** Parallelism is sibling calls inside `<minimax:tool_call>`, not JSON `tool_calls` and not one envelope per required batch.
- **Schema determines strings.** Without the tool schema, even a JavaScript string renderer value is JSON-quoted; supply tool definitions to renderer/scanner APIs for round trips.
- **No ids on the wire.** OMP-generated ids are internal. Preserve call/result order.
- **Errors are first-class records.** Use `<error>/<stderr>`, not a successful `<result>` containing an out-of-band error flag.
- **Canonical wrapper vs accepted recovery syntax.** The parser accepts bare invokes and `<tool_call>`, but the injected contract requires `<minimax:tool_call>`.
- **Complete the invoke before stopping.** A natural-language promise to call a tool is not a call; the closing `</invoke>` is what finalizes coercion and the normal lifecycle.

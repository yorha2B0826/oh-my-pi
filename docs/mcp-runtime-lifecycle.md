# MCP runtime lifecycle

This document describes how MCP servers are discovered, connected, exposed as tools, refreshed, and torn down in the coding-agent runtime.

## Lifecycle at a glance

1. **SDK startup** kicks off MCP discovery (unless MCP is disabled): headless/SDK sessions await `discoverAndLoadMCPTools()`; interactive sessions (`hasUI: true`) create the manager up front and defer `discoverAndConnect()` until the session is live.
2. **Discovery** (`loadAllMCPConfigs`) resolves MCP server configs from capability sources, filters disabled/project/Exa entries and browser MCP servers when the built-in browser tool is enabled, and preserves source metadata.
3. **Manager connect phase** (`MCPManager.connectServers`) starts per-server connect + `tools/list` in parallel.
4. **Fast startup gate** waits up to 250ms, then may return:
   - fully loaded `MCPTool`s,
   - failures per server,
   - or cached `DeferredMCPTool`s for still-pending servers.
5. **SDK wiring** merges MCP tools into runtime tool registry for the session.
6. **Post-connect enrichment** best-effort loads resources, resource templates, prompts, and optional resource subscriptions.
7. **Live session** receives late tool changes through the manager callback; `/mcp reload` does `disconnectAll` + rediscovery + `session.refreshMCPTools`, while transport close and `/mcp reconnect` use the per-server reconnect path.
8. **Teardown** happens on explicit manager disconnects and automatically when an owning `AgentSession` is disposed; borrowed parent managers are not disconnected by subagents.

## Discovery and load phase

### Entry path from SDK

`createAgentSession()` in `src/sdk.ts` performs MCP startup when `enableMCP` is true (default). There are two paths:

- **Headless/SDK** (no UI, no provided manager): awaits `discoverAndLoadMCPTools(cwd, { ... })` and merges the returned tools into the startup `customTools` set.
- **Interactive/TUI** (`hasUI: true`, no provided manager): constructs `MCPManager` immediately (with cache + auth storage), defers `discoverAndConnect()` to a background task started after the session exists, then binds tools via `session.refreshMCPTools(...)` (disposing the manager if the session was torn down mid-connect).

Both paths:

- pass `authStorage`, cache storage, `mcp.enableProjectConfig`, and browser-MCP filtering based on the `browser.enabled` setting,
- always set `filterExa: true`,
- log per-server load/connect errors,
- store the manager in `toolSession.mcpManager` and the session result.

If `enableMCP` is false, MCP discovery is skipped entirely.

### Config discovery and filtering

`loadAllMCPConfigs()` (`src/mcp/config.ts`) loads canonical MCP server items through capability discovery, then converts to legacy `MCPServerConfig`.

Filtering behavior:

- `enableProjectConfig: false` removes project-level entries (`_source.level === "project"`).
- `enabled: false` entries are suppressed unless the active-profile user `enabledServers` allowlist names them; the user `disabledServers` denylist always suppresses a same-named entry.
- Exa servers are filtered out by default and API keys are extracted for native Exa tool integration, unless the config explicitly requests Exa tools the native integration does not provide (`web_fetch_exa`, `web_search_advanced_exa`); browser automation MCP servers are filtered when `filterBrowser` is true.

Result includes both `configs` and `sources` (metadata used later for provider labeling).

### Discovery-level failure behavior

`discoverAndLoadMCPTools()` distinguishes two failure classes:

- **Discovery hard failure** (exception from `manager.discoverAndConnect`, typically from config discovery): returns an empty tool set and one synthetic error `{ path: ".mcp.json", error }`.
- **Per-server runtime/connect failure**: manager returns partial success with `errors` map; other servers continue.

So startup does not fail the whole agent session when individual MCP servers fail.

## Manager state model

`MCPManager` tracks runtime lifecycle with separate registries:

- `#connections: Map<string, MCPServerConnection>` — fully connected servers.
- `#pendingConnections: Map<string, Promise<MCPServerConnection>>` — handshake in progress.
- `#pendingToolLoads: Map<string, Promise<{ connection, serverTools }>>` — initialized connections whose `tools/list` is still in flight.
- `#tools: CustomTool[]` — current MCP tool view exposed to callers, kept in stable name order.
- `#sources: Map<string, SourceMeta>` — provider/source metadata even before connect completes.
- `#pendingReconnections: Map<string, Promise<MCPServerConnection | null>>` — reconnects in progress after a dropped transport or explicit reconnect.
- `#serverConfigs: Map<string, MCPServerConfig>` — original unresolved configs preserved so reconnect can re-resolve credentials without leaking resolved tokens.
- `#reconnectHistory: Map<string, number[]>` plus `#epoch` — per-server crash-window accounting and invalidation of reconnect attempts that outlive a global disconnect.
- listener/callback state, including a bounded pending-notification FIFO and tracked resource subscriptions/refreshes.

`getConnectionStatus(name)` derives status from these maps:

- `connected` if in `#connections`,
- `connecting` if pending connect, pending tool load, or pending reconnect,
- `disconnected` otherwise.

## Connection establishment and startup timing

### Per-server connect pipeline

For each discovered server in `connectServers()`:

1. store/update source metadata,
2. skip if already connected/pending/reconnecting,
3. validate transport fields (`validateServerConfig`),
4. save the unresolved config for possible reconnect,
5. resolve managed OAuth credentials and env/header shell substitutions (`#resolveAuthConfig`),
6. call `connectToServer(name, resolvedConfig)` with manager notification/request handlers,
7. wire HTTP OAuth refresh and transport `onClose` reconnect handling,
8. call `listTools(connection)`,
9. cache tool definitions (`MCPToolCache.set`) best-effort,
10. best-effort load resources, resource templates, prompts, and subscriptions after tools load.

`connectToServer()` behavior (`src/mcp/client.ts`):

- creates stdio or HTTP/SSE transport,
- performs MCP `initialize` using protocol version `2025-03-26` and advertises the `roots` capability,
- answers server-to-client `ping` and `roots/list` requests; unsupported request methods return JSON-RPC `-32601`,
- for HTTP/SSE, starts the background SSE listener before `notifications/initialized`,
- sends `notifications/initialized`,
- uses timeout precedence `OMP_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS`, then `config.timeout`, then 30s; `0` disables the client-side timeout,
- closes transport on init failure.

### Fast startup gate + deferred fallback

`connectServers()` waits on a race between:

- all connect/tool-load tasks settled, and
- `STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS = 250`.

After 250ms:

- fulfilled tasks become live `MCPTool`s,
- rejected tasks produce per-server errors,
- still-pending tasks:
  - use cached tool definitions if available (`MCPToolCache.get`) to create `DeferredMCPTool`s,
  - otherwise contribute no tools at startup; they stay in flight, and the background continuation registers their tools via `#onToolsChanged` once connect/list finishes (a slow server no longer blocks startup — issue #2100).

This is a hybrid startup model: fast return with deferred handles when cache is available, late background registration when it is not.

### Background completion behavior

Each pending `toolsPromise` also has a background continuation that eventually:

- replaces that server's tool slice in manager state and restores stable name ordering,
- invokes `#onToolsChanged` so a live session can rebind the late tools,
- writes cache,
- logs late failures only after startup (`allowBackgroundLogging`).

## Tool exposure and live-session availability

### Startup registration

`discoverAndLoadMCPTools()` converts manager tools into `LoadedCustomTool[]` and decorates paths (`mcp:<server> via <providerName>` when known).

`createAgentSession()` then pushes these tools into `customTools`, which are wrapped and added to the runtime tool registry with names like `mcp__<server>_<tool>`.

Server and tool name components are lowercased and sanitized to letters/underscores. If two distinct origins mint the same runtime name, OMP logs the collision and keeps a deterministic winner based on the original server/tool identity, so reconnect ordering cannot change ownership.

### Tool calls

- `MCPTool` calls tools through an already connected `MCPServerConnection`.
- `DeferredMCPTool` waits for `waitForConnection(server)` before calling; this allows cached tools to exist before connection is ready.
- Both attempt a reconnect + single retry for retriable connection failures.
- A structured tool-result auth challenge can trigger the configured auth handler, reconnect, and one retry. Interactive mode wires this to the `/mcp` OAuth controller; without a handler the challenge remains an MCP error.

Both return structured tool output and convert remaining transport/tool errors into `MCP error: ...` tool content (abort remains abort).

## Refresh/reload paths (startup vs live reload)

### Initial startup path

- one-time discovery/load in `sdk.ts`,
- tools are registered in initial session tool registry.

### Interactive reload and live-change paths

`/mcp reload` (`src/modes/controllers/mcp-command-controller.ts`) does:

1. `mcpManager.disconnectAll()`,
2. clears stale MCP prompt commands,
3. calls `mcpManager.discoverAndConnect()` with the same project/Exa/browser filters as startup,
4. calls `session.refreshMCPTools(mcpManager.getTools())`.

`session.refreshMCPTools()` (`src/session/agent-session.ts`) removes all `mcp__` tools, re-wraps the latest MCP tools, and re-activates the tool set so changes apply without restarting. The owning SDK session also installs `setOnToolsChanged`, so late initial connections, server `tools/list_changed` notifications, reconnects, and disconnects can trigger the same rebinding. Explicit `/mcp reconnect <name>` performs one final refresh after the manager reconnect completes.

## Server-initiated notifications

MCP servers may push JSON-RPC notification frames at any point after `initialize` completes. The transport surfaces them via `onNotification`; the manager fans them out in two paths:

1. **Internal refresh** for known methods:
   - `notifications/tools/list_changed` → `refreshServerTools`
   - `notifications/resources/list_changed` → `refreshServerResources`
   - `notifications/resources/updated` → `#onResourcesChanged` (only for currently subscribed URIs)
   - `notifications/prompts/list_changed` → `refreshServerPrompts`
2. **Listener fanout**: every notification (known and server-custom) is delivered after any internal refresh. `MCPManager.addNotificationListener(listener)` returns an unsubscribe function; multiple listeners have independent error isolation.

If no listener is attached, the manager buffers up to 100 frames, dropping the oldest on overflow, then drains the FIFO into the first listener that attaches. `sdk.ts` registers a per-session listener that bridges to the extension runner's `mcp_notification` event with `{ server, method, params }`; the extension runner has its own bounded startup buffer. The listener and debounce timers are released through session postmortem cleanup.

## Health, reconnect, and partial failure behavior

Current runtime behavior is connection-event driven:

- **No autonomous polling health monitor** in manager/client.
- **Automatic reconnect is wired to `transport.onClose`** for managed connections.
- Reconnect retries with backoff (`500`, `1000`, `2000`, `4000` ms), reloads tools, and notifies consumers on success. A crash-storm circuit breaker suspends automatic reconnects for a server after more than 5 reconnect attempts within 30s; manual `/mcp reconnect` resets that history.
- Tool calls that see retriable connection errors also attempt one reconnect + retry.
- Reconnect is also explicit via `/mcp reconnect <name>` or broader `/mcp reload`.

Operationally:

- one server failing does not remove tools from healthy servers,
- connect/list failures are isolated per server,
- stale tools may remain visible while reconnect is attempted; calls report MCP errors if recovery fails,
- tool cache, resource/prompt loading, subscriptions, and background updates are best-effort (warnings/errors logged, no hard stop).

## Teardown semantics

### Server-level teardown

`disconnectServer(name)`:

- removes pending connect/tool-load/reconnect entries, source metadata, saved config, reconnect history, and resource refresh/subscription state,
- detaches `onClose` so explicit close does not trigger reconnect,
- closes the transport if connected,
- removes tools by their exact `mcpServerName` owner (not by a sanitized name prefix) and notifies tool consumers,
- notifies prompt consumers when stale prompt commands need removal.

### Global teardown and ownership

`disconnectAll()`:

- increments a lifecycle epoch so reconnect attempts that finish later cannot resurrect old connections,
- detaches `onClose` for all active transports, then closes them with `Promise.allSettled`,
- clears pending maps, sources, saved configs, connections, subscriptions, resource refreshes, reconnect history, and manager tools.

Top-level sessions own managers they create. `AgentSession.dispose()` disconnects that owned manager with a 3-second cleanup timeout and logs cleanup failure; a subagent/session given `options.mcpManager` borrows the parent manager and does not disconnect it. `/mcp reload` deliberately reuses the manager object after `disconnectAll`, so installed callbacks/listeners remain available for the next discovery cycle.

## Public API surface

`src/mcp/index.ts` re-exports client operations, config loader/writer APIs, loader and manager APIs, OAuth discovery, tool bridges/cache, HTTP and stdio transports, protocol types, plus `callMCP`/`parseSSE`. `src/sdk.ts` exposes `discoverMCPServers()` as a convenience wrapper over `discoverAndLoadMCPTools`; it returns `{ manager, tools, errors, connectedServers, exaApiKeys }`.

# System Prompt Customization

How the coding agent assembles its system prompt and what users can control with `SYSTEM.md`, `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`, `TITLE_SYSTEM.md`, and the matching CLI flags.

Primary implementation:

- `packages/coding-agent/src/main.ts` (`discoverSystemPromptFile`, `discoverAppendSystemPromptFile`, `applyResolvedSystemPromptInputs`)
- `packages/coding-agent/src/sdk.ts` (`CreateAgentSessionOptions`, prompt construction)
- `packages/coding-agent/src/system-prompt.ts` (`buildSystemPrompt`, `resolvePromptInput`)
- `packages/coding-agent/src/prompts/system/system-prompt.md` (default instruction template)
- `packages/coding-agent/src/prompts/system/custom-system-prompt.md` (template used when `SYSTEM.md` is active)
- `packages/coding-agent/src/prompts/system/project-prompt.md` (project/environment footer)

## Inputs and precedence

| Input                                   | Source                 | Effect                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--system-prompt <text-or-file>`        | CLI                    | Uses the bundled custom-prompt template instead of the default instruction template. Highest precedence. |
| `SYSTEM.md`                             | Discovered config file | Same template switch as the flag; used when the flag is absent.                                          |
| `--append-system-prompt <text-or-file>` | CLI                    | Adds text to the rendered prompt. Highest append precedence.                                             |
| `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`                      | Discovered config file | Same effect as the append flag; used when the flag is absent.                                            |

`SYSTEM.md` and `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` are searched project-first, then user-level. At each scope the config bases are ordered `.omp`, `.claude`, `.codex`, `.gemini`:

1. `<cwd>/.omp/<file>`, `<cwd>/.claude/<file>`, `<cwd>/.codex/<file>`, `<cwd>/.gemini/<file>`
2. `~/.omp/agent/<file>`, `~/.claude/<file>`, `~/.codex/<file>`, `~/.gemini/<file>`

The native user path follows the active profile: with `omp --profile work`, `~/.omp/agent` becomes `~/.omp/profiles/work/agent`. `PI_CONFIG_DIR` changes the native config-directory name. This shared config lookup does not use `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` as an arbitrary replacement base.

Discovery does **not** walk ancestors. Starting OMP in `<repo>/packages/api` does not discover `<repo>/.omp/SYSTEM.md`; launch from `<repo>`, put the file under the current directory's config base, or use a user-level file. See [Configuration usage](./config-usage.md) for the shared config-directory contract.

A flag wins over every discovered file. For each filename, project scope wins over user scope and the first config base in the order above wins within that scope.

### Text or file resolution

For a single-line value, OMP first tries to read that value as a file path. If reading fails because the path does not exist (or is too long to be a path), the value is used literally. A value containing a newline is used literally without a file read. Other file-read failures are logged and the original value is still used literally.

## What `SYSTEM.md` replaces

`SYSTEM.md` does not become a raw, sole system message. The CLI stores it as `CreateAgentSessionOptions.customSystemPrompt`, and `buildSystemPrompt` renders `custom-system-prompt.md` instead of the default `system-prompt.md`.

The custom template keeps these generated surfaces:

- the custom text and any append text;
- discovered context files;
- discovered skills;
- always-apply rules and the rulebook listing;
- secret-redaction guidance when enabled.

The separate project/environment footer remains and carries workstation data, deeper-directory context pointers, optional workspace information, and the final completion requirements. Optional extra system blocks, such as computer-tool safety and active nested-repository context, also remain when applicable.

The current date and working directory no longer live in the footer: they are emitted as a `<system-reminder>` block on the first user turn of each provider request (`date-cwd-reminder.md`). Keeping per-request bytes out of the system prompt lets open-weight providers (DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, …) that render tool schemas after the system content keep their prefix cache, and lets a session crossing midnight refresh the date without rebuilding the prompt (#7404).

What disappears is the content unique to the default instruction template: its built-in role/personality text, tool inventory and general tool policy, internal-URL catalog, exploration/delegation/workflow rules, and `xd://` protocol guidance. Generated skills and rules are **not** lost; the custom template renders them explicitly.

Consequences:

- To add a few instructions while retaining the complete default prompt, use only `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` or `--append-system-prompt`.
- To replace the default instruction template while retaining generated project context, skills, and rules, use `SYSTEM.md` or `--system-prompt`.
- If a custom prompt still needs the default tool policy or workflow, copy and maintain the required guidance yourself; selective inheritance from `system-prompt.md` is not supported.

### Append placement

Without `SYSTEM.md`, append text is rendered at the end of `project-prompt.md`, after the default instruction block and project/environment content.

With `SYSTEM.md`, append text is rendered immediately after the custom text in `custom-system-prompt.md`. Context, skills, and rules follow it, and the separate project/environment footer follows that block. The templates prevent the append text and context files from being emitted twice.

SDK-generated append content (for enabled memory/auto-learn features and MCP guidance) is combined before the user-supplied append text.

## Plain-text contract

`SYSTEM.md`, `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`, `--system-prompt`, and `--append-system-prompt` are plain text. They are values inserted into bundled Handlebars templates; their contents are not recursively compiled as Handlebars.

For example, if `SYSTEM.md` contains:

```handlebars
Working in
{{cwd}}
on
{{date}}.
{{#if hasMemoryRoot}}Memory enabled.{{/if}}
```

those characters reach the model literally. Internal values such as `cwd`, `skills`, `rules`, and `toolRefs` are private template implementation details, not a user templating API. The calendar date is deliberately not exposed as a template value anymore — it rides the per-request first-turn reminder instead (see above).

## Recipes

### Add rules to the default prompt

Create `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` without a `SYSTEM.md`:

```text
# ~/.omp/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md
Prefer Bun APIs over Node APIs in this project.
When you change a public function, run `bun check` before yielding.
```

### Supply a custom base prompt

```text
# <cwd>/.omp/SYSTEM.md
You are a code reviewer. Read changes, surface concrete issues, and never edit files.
Cite paths with backticks.
```

OMP still adds the generated context, skills, rules, and project/environment footer, but not the default instruction template's tool and workflow guidance.

### Customize automatic session titles

`SYSTEM.md` and `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` do not affect title-generation calls. Use `TITLE_SYSTEM.md`:

```text
# ~/.omp/agent/TITLE_SYSTEM.md
Generate a session name using lowercase `<type>:<primary-objective>`.
If the message has no concrete task, output exactly `none`.
```

`TITLE_SYSTEM.md` uses the same project-first, config-base discovery and no-ancestor-walk behavior. When absent, OMP uses its bundled title prompt. The override is used for both initial automatic titles and replan-driven title refreshes.

Generated title output has an enforced normalization contract even with a
custom prompt. OMP considers only the first trimmed line, strips surrounding
quotes, `<title>...</title>` markers, and terminal punctuation, and treats
`none` or `<title/>` as “no title yet.” A result longer than 80 characters or
12 words is rejected rather than truncated. Empty, deferred, or rejected output
leaves the session unnamed, so a later eligible title attempt can name it.

## Full provider-facing replacement (SDK only)

`CreateAgentSessionOptions.systemPrompt` is a different, lower-level API. A string or array replaces the fully rendered default blocks; a callback receives the rendered block array and returns its replacement. This can omit all generated context and safety blocks.

The CLI flags and files do **not** set this property: they set `customSystemPrompt` and `appendSystemPrompt`, which continue through the bundled templates described above.

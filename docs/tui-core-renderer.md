# TUI core renderer — explicit history and viewport contract

This document describes the core renderer contract. The relevant implementation
lives in:

- [`packages/tui/src/tui.ts`](../packages/tui/src/tui.ts) — frame planning,
  history emission, viewport diffing, overlays, and cursor placement.
- [`packages/tui/src/terminal.ts`](../packages/tui/src/terminal.ts) — terminal I/O,
  capability probes, and private-CSI reassembly.
- [`packages/tui/src/utils.ts`](../packages/tui/src/utils.ts) — ANSI-aware width,
  slicing, truncation, and wrapping.
- [`packages/tui/src/kitty-graphics.ts`](../packages/tui/src/kitty-graphics.ts) and
  [`packages/tui/src/components/image.ts`](../packages/tui/src/components/image.ts)
  — inline images and their memory budget.

Application code owns transcript lifecycle. The renderer does not inspect the
component tree to guess which rows are final.

## 1. Frame ownership

A product installs a `TerminalFrameProvider` with `TUI.setFrameProvider()`. On
each render the provider receives the current `ViewportSize` and returns a
`TerminalFramePlan`:

```ts
interface HistoryBatch {
  readonly id: number;
  readonly rows: readonly string[];
  readonly kind?: "append" | "replay";
}

interface TerminalFramePlan {
  readonly history?: HistoryBatch;
  readonly viewport: readonly string[];
}
```

`viewport` is the complete mutable screen image for this frame. An `append`
history batch contains finalized rows or a stable append-only head row. A
`replay` batch contains the complete logical ledger, including any naturally
emitted prefix of the active append-only head. Finality
is therefore an application decision, never an inference from a row crossing
the top of the terminal.

A history batch has a monotonic id. The TUI writes each accepted batch exactly
once, then acknowledges that id to the provider. The provider retains a pending
batch until acknowledgement and does not reuse or reorder ids. This handshake
makes retries and coalesced renders safe without requiring the renderer to
compare a new transcript with terminal scrollback.

`packages/tui/src/chrome/transcript-container.ts` owns the active, settled, and
committed block lifecycle for the coding agent. Blocks are mutable by default. Assistant/thinking producers
explicitly opt into append-only presentation and publish only a monotonically
extending prefix of complete stable semantic rows. Each row re-renders at the
current width; open Markdown and the current partial suffix remain mutable. Under pressure,
only the current logical head can emit enough stable rows to relieve overflow without finalizing. Final
retirement writes only its un-emitted suffix.

## 2. Rendering a frame

For every frame the TUI:

1. Requests a plan from the product's frame provider.
2. Appends an unacknowledged history batch, if any, exactly once and
   acknowledges its id.
3. Anchors the mutable viewport immediately below retained terminal history.
4. Normalizes and width-fits viewport rows, composites overlays, and emits only
   the changed viewport rows.
5. Parks the hardware cursor at the real content position inside the
   synchronized-output frame.

History and viewport have deliberately different update rules. History is an
ordered append stream; viewport rows are replaceable and diffed against the
previous viewport. A replay is one atomic exception: the renderer moves the
ledger suffix that fits into leading blank viewport rows, retains the prefix as
history remainder, prepares `remainder || finalViewport`, and performs one
synchronous `terminal.write`. No block-at-a-time replay frames are observable.
Ordinary renders never audit or rewrite terminal history.

Visible overlays are screen-coordinate content. They composite over the
viewport and never become history. Showing, updating, or closing an overlay
only repaints the viewport.

## 3. Reset and resize behavior

Destructive display resets are gesture-driven. `resetDisplay()` and explicit
session replacement may clear terminal history and repaint the current product
state because the user action establishes a new display boundary. Ordinary
renders never clear history.

A resize invalidates viewport geometry and repaints the viewport at the new
width and height. After a settled resize, `ResizeScrollbackMode` selects
how retained history is handled (including cleanup of live rows a height
shrink may have pushed before the resize callback ran):

- `rebuild` clears native history and replays one current-width transcript;
- `append` retains native history and appends a current-width transcript copy
  on width changes (height-only resizes do not append a duplicate);
- `preserve` repaints only the viewport and leaves old-width history unchanged.

The raw TUI defaults to `preserve` and accepts
`PI_TUI_RESIZE_SCROLLBACK`; the coding agent defaults to `rebuild`. Append and
rebuild resize policies each prepare one complete bottom-first replay
transaction; preserve prepares none. Replay consumes one fresh monotonic history
id without rewinding logical retirement state, and acknowledgement happens only
after the synchronous write returns.

In-place resize (Warp by default outside multiplexers/ConPTY, or forced with
`PI_TUI_RESIZE_IN_PLACE=1`) skips resize replay entirely and repaints once the
drag settles. `PI_TUI_RESIZE_IN_PLACE=0` forces the borrowed-buffer path.
See [runtime resize details](./tui-runtime-internals.md#resize).

The renderer never probes the user's scroll position. This keeps updates safe
while the user is reading older terminal history and avoids terminal- or
platform-specific finality policy.

## 4. ANSI and width invariants

`visibleWidth`, `truncateToWidth`, `sliceByColumn`, and `wrapTextWithAnsi` share
one ANSI-aware UAX#11 width model. Measuring, slicing, truncation, and wrapping
must route through these helpers so escape sequences remain zero-width and
column boundaries agree.

- Printable ASCII uses the fast one-cell-per-code-unit path.
- Non-ASCII text uses the shared narrow-ambiguous width model, with a shared
  terminal/platform-aware Hangul Compatibility Jamo correction.
- Tabs use `DEFAULT_TAB_WIDTH`.
- OSC 66 sized spans contribute their declared cell width.
- Over-wide rows are truncated to the viewport width; the render hot path must
  not throw for a cosmetic width mismatch.

ANSI state is normalized at row boundaries so independently updated rows remain
valid. Cursor writes stay inside synchronized output, before ESU, to avoid a
second visible frame.

## 5. Terminal capabilities and input probes

Terminal detection selects optimizations such as synchronized output, DECCARA,
and image protocols; it does not change history semantics.

Inside tmux, the pane environment identifies tmux rather than the attached
emulator. At startup, terminal detection asks the local tmux server for
`#{client_termtype}` and maps recognized client names through the normal
capability table; an unavailable `tmux` command or missing terminal-type reply
keeps the environment fallback. Modified keys still require tmux
`extended-keys`, while OSC notifications require `allow-passthrough`.

`ProcessTerminal` pairs capability queries with typed DA1 sentinel owners.
Private CSI replies may be split across stdin flushes, so reassembly must retain
partial replies until their terminator and must not leak probe bytes as user
input. New probes need a typed sentinel owner and byte-by-byte split-reply
coverage.

### Native rendering (Tern Surface Protocol)

`ProcessTerminal` also sends the TSP `hello` query (APC `tsp`) behind a `tsp`
DA1 sentinel owner. `PI_TUI_NATIVE=0` disables it; multiplexers and Bun tests
skip it by default, while `PI_TUI_NATIVE=1` forces the probe. A supported-version
reply switches `TUI` to `native/backend.ts`: components
are described (`describe()`, or `rows` fallback from `render()`), reconciled
into document ops (`native/reconcile.ts`) and sent as frames, paced by the
terminal's acknowledgements instead of the render cadence. None of this
document's history, viewport, resize-replay or CPR machinery runs on that path;
SIGWINCH only refreshes the width used by `rows` fallback nodes. While a surface
is live the nerd symbol preset is forced process-locally, and icon glyphs are
sent as `icon` spans. Each surface receives omp's resolved theme (`t`: every
theme token as hex, dark and light variants) after `o` and before its first
frame, and again when the resolved palette changes. The first row paint waits
up to 300 ms for the probe. Direct Tern sessions optimistically open a surface
immediately and fall back to rows if the terminal does not confirm it. Such a
session needs raw input from the start, so a `deferInput` start holds the
keystrokes meant for the component focused at start instead of leaving the tty
cooked; a dialog that takes focus meanwhile (a startup hook's select or confirm)
gets its input live, and the hold survives the TUI stop/start of an external
editor opened from such a dialog. A swapped-in custom editor inherits the hold
through `Composer.setEditor()` (`TUI.replaceHeldFocus()`), so its keys queue
behind the held ones, and it keeps the startup submit gate. The cell-size reply
is still consumed on arrival, and the sixel probe is skipped on a TSP terminal,
so no probe listener sees held keys. `InteractiveMode.init()` calls
`TUI.releaseHeldInput()` after startup hooks, mode reconcile, draft restore and
every session subscription, just before lifting the submit gate: held keys edit
the restored draft instead of racing it, a startup shortcut acts on the final,
observed session, and a held Enter is still ignored. Ctrl+C/Ctrl+D release the
queue early. The
debug socket's `doc` op returns the reference document
(every sent frame applied by `native/apply.ts`), and `tsp` returns recent frames.

#### Explicit composer submission

omp's `q: "hello"` advertises `features: ["edit", "undo", "send"]`.
The `editor`/`input` prop `sendable` is separate from text editability:
`sendable: true` means the owner is ready to accept an atomic prompt submission.
An absent or false value is not ready, even if the field is writable or focused.
Base `Editor` and `Input` fields publish false because they do not handle `send`.
The prompt `CustomEditor` publishes true only when its `onSubmit` handler exists
and `disableSubmit` is false.

During interactive bootstrap the composer stays writable with `sendable: false`.
Once all handlers and subscriptions are ready, init lifts the submit gate and
requests a render to publish `sendable: true`, without requiring user input.
A terminal must retain a pending prompt until that readiness update arrives; it
must not dispatch early, sleep, poll, or defer a simulated Enter.

A terminal that sees `"send"` and a ready composer may submit a supplied prompt
with an `e` message:

```json
{"ev":"send","sf":"s:1","id":"k.line/input","text":"First line\nSecond line"}
```

`sf` must name a live surface and `id` its editable composer node (the
`editor` descendant of the `omp.editor` role, normally `<component>.line/input`),
not the composer wrapper or its Send button. All three payload fields are
required strings; surface and node ids must be nonempty. Malformed payloads,
unknown or closed surfaces, and stale/noneditable node targets are ignored.
The terminal must also require `sendable === true` on the addressed node before
dispatching the advertised `send` event. The backend resolves the node's owner and delivers
`{ type: "send", key: "line/input", text }`, independent of keyboard focus.

`CustomEditor` submits this text once through its ordinary `submit()` /
`onSubmit` path. Multiline text remains one prompt; the usual loaded-text
normalization, outer-whitespace trimming, command processing, main-versus-viewed
agent routing and submitted history rules still apply. This is not a paste:
large prompts do not open the large-paste selection menu, and the terminal
must not follow the event with a simulated Enter. Empty or whitespace-only
text is a no-op, never a submission of the existing draft or a stream interrupt.
Disabled or not-yet-wired composers also leave the draft untouched.

Before a nonblank send replaces a draft, the old text, paste expansions and
attachments are retained in local recall history (not persisted as a submitted
prompt). The explicit payload is submitted by itself, without those old
attachments or paste expansions. Sends wait in the input FIFO until any
in-flight clipboard/attachment work settles, including failures, so the
displaced draft is saved only after its pending attachments finish arriving.
Native Send-button actions keep their existing behavior: they submit the
current draft rather than an explicit payload.

## 6. Inline images and memory

Kitty images are transmit-once, place-many. `ImageBudget` retains only the most
recent images; demotion deletes image pixels by id and repaints the affected
viewport rows with the height-preserving text fallback. It does not replay
history. An image already retained in terminal history may lose its pixels when
demoted because historical rows are immutable.

Never retransmit full base64 image data on every frame. Kitty Unicode
placeholders remain capability-gated and can be overridden with the existing
image environment settings.

## 7. Core invariants

1. Products decide finality and submit finalized or declared append-only stable
   rows only through ordered `HistoryBatch` values.
2. The TUI writes a history batch exactly once and acknowledges its monotonic
   id; it never derives history from viewport row position.
3. Ordinary frames diff and repaint the viewport only. They never rewrite,
   audit, clear, or replay retained history.
4. Settled resizes follow the configured replay mode without deriving
   history from cross-width physical row arithmetic.
5. Only explicit display resets and `rebuild` resize mode destructively clear
   native history.
6. Overlays and image-budget changes remain viewport-local.
7. Width handling uses the shared ANSI-aware helpers and clamps rather than
   throwing in the render hot path.
8. The renderer never probes terminal scroll position. Terminal/multiplexer
   geometry controls resize mechanics (including the in-place no-replay path),
   not block finality.

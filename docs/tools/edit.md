# edit

> Applies source edits. The default `hashline` mode consumes one line-anchored patch string and edits existing files directly.

## Mode selection and availability

`edit` is an essential built-in tool. `resolveEditMode()` selects the active wire contract in this order:

1. model-specific configured variant;
2. `PI_EDIT_VARIANT`;
3. `edit.mode`;
4. default `hashline`.

Supported modes are `hashline`, `apply_patch`, `patch`, `replace`, and `sloppy`. `edit.modelVariants` uses the first case-insensitive substring match against the active model string. `PI_EDIT_VARIANT` pins the mode exactly; for settings-derived `hashline`, `PI_STRICT_EDIT_MODE` disables the model-family fallback to `replace` (Kimi, MiMo, MiniMax, DeepSeek, StepFun, Codex Spark, and GLM 5.3 Flash).

This page primarily documents hashline. The schema, prompt, examples, renderer, and optional Lark format switch with the mode. Models with `editPromptVariant: "compact"` receive the compact hashline prompt. In `apply_patch` custom-tool mode the wire name is `apply_patch`; dispatch still reaches the same internal tool. The tool is strict, essential, and uses exclusive concurrency.

## Input

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | `string` | Yes | One or more `[PATH#TAG]` sections containing hashline operations. The strict custom-tool grammar wraps the sections in `*** Begin Patch` / `*** End Patch`; the normal parser also accepts an unwrapped payload. |

Each section edits one existing file and MUST copy the four-uppercase-hex snapshot tag from the latest anchored `read`, `grep`, or successful `edit` result:

```text
[src/example.ts#1A2B]
PUT 4.=4:
+const value = 2;
```

Use `write` to create or wholly overwrite a file. Hashline rejects untagged anchored edits at application time.

## Canonical patch language

All line numbers refer to the original tagged snapshot, not to earlier hunks in the same call.

| Form | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `PUT N.=M:` | Replace inclusive original lines `N..M` with the following `+TEXT` rows. |
| `PUT N*:` | Replace the multi-line syntactic block beginning on line `N`. |
| `PUT <N:` / `PUT >N:` | Insert body rows immediately before / after line `N`. `PUT <1:` is file head. |
| `PUT >$:` | Append body rows at file tail. |
| `PUT >N*:` | Insert after the syntactic block beginning on line `N`. |
| `CUT N.=M` / `CUT N*` | Delete and capture an inclusive range or resolved block. Add `@name` to write a named register. |
| `PUT <N` / `PUT >N` / `PUT >$` | Paste the anonymous register into a gap. |
| `PUT <N @name` / `PUT >N @name` / `PUT >$ @name` | Paste a named register into a gap. |
| `PUT N.=M @name` / `PUT N* @name` | Replace a range or block with a named register. Named registers are required for span/block paste. |
| `REM` | Delete the section file. |
| `MV DEST` | Write the edited file to the destination, then delete the source. Existing destination contents can be overwritten; quote destinations containing spaces. |

Register names contain ASCII letters, digits, `_`, or `-`. The anonymous register is batch-local and starts empty on every call. Named registers persist for the session and are published only after their writes land. Operations run top-to-bottom across sections, so a cut in an earlier section can feed a later paste. Repeating a paste does not consume its register.

Only body-bearing `PUT ...:` headers take body rows. Every body row is `+TEXT`; `+` alone inserts a blank line. The body is final content, never a unified-diff before/after pair. Literal content beginning with `-` or `+` is written as `+-...` or `++...`. `CUT`, register-backed `PUT`, `REM`, and `MV` take no body.

### Block anchors

Block forms resolve from the opening line through the tree-sitter node's end. Anchor the construct opener, never a closing delimiter, last visible line, blank line, or inner statement. A single-line node is rejected with guidance to use the corresponding explicit-line operation. `PUT >N*:` lowers to ordinary `PUT >N:` with a warning when no block resolves; replace/cut block forms fail instead of guessing.

Leading decorators, attributes, and doc-comments may be separate syntax nodes. Anchor the first decorator when the parser groups it with the declaration; otherwise use an explicit range. Standalone line comments are not swept automatically. In Markdown, a heading's block includes its body and deeper subsections through the next heading of equal or higher level.

Use tight ranges and separate non-adjacent changes. Do not use `edit` merely to reformat or restyle code; run the project's formatter after the substantive edit.

## Examples

Given:

```text
[greet.py#A1B2]
1:@cache
2:def greet(name):
3:    print("Hello, " + name)
4:
5:greet("world")
```

Replace the decorated function without touching its caller:

```text
*** Begin Patch
[greet.py#A1B2]
PUT 1*:
+@cache
+def greet(name):
+    print(f"Hi, {name}")
*** End Patch
```

Move it to another previously-read file using a named register:

```text
*** Begin Patch
[greet.py#A1B2]
CUT 1* @fn
[lib/greet.py#3C4D]
PUT <1 @fn
*** End Patch
```

Rename after editing:

```text
*** Begin Patch
[greet.py#A1B2]
PUT 5.=5:
+greet("team")
MV lib/welcome.py
*** End Patch
```

## Other wire contracts

| Mode | Parameters | Edit form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `replace` | `path`, `old_string`, `new_string`, optional `replace_all` | Replace quoted text in one file. |
| `patch` | `path`, `edits: Array<{ op?: "create" \| "delete" \| "update"; rename?: string; diff?: string }>` | Patch entries all target the top-level `path`; separate calls for different files. |
| `apply_patch` | `input` | Combined `*** Begin Patch` payload with `*** Add File`, `*** Update File`, `*** Move to`, and `*** Delete File` sections. |
| `sloppy` | `input` | `*** Edit File: path`, then `*** Find` plus `*** Replace`, `*** Insert Before`, or `*** Insert After`. |

`sloppy` uses existing-text anchors, not snapshot tags. Find must identify one match unless the file header ends in ` all`; bare `*** Edit File:` continues the current target. Bodies are raw text, without diff prefixes or closing markers. `…` in Find captures omitted text; Replace re-emits those captures in order. Insert keeps the anchor and treats `…` literally. Every pair addresses the original file; matching/validation failures occur before writes.

The mode prompts in `crates/pi-edit/prompts/` define the full syntax.

## Output and side effects

Hashline applies in one tool call; it does not use the staged `xd://resolve` / `xd://reject` flow used by `ast_edit`.

A successful hashline section returns a fresh `[path#TAG]` header, optional block-resolution and move lines, a compact post-edit preview when available, and a `Warnings:` block when recovery or normalization produced warnings. `EditToolDetails` can include the unified `diff`, `firstChangedLine`, diagnostics, operation (`update` or `delete` in hashline mode), path/move metadata, `oldText` / `newText`, `snapshotsPruned`, and per-file results. Multi-section input returns one aggregate result. Stored before/after snapshot text is capped at 32,768 characters per file and across a multi-file result; later entries may retain their diff but omit snapshot text.

Native parse/match/application and writer failures return `isError: true` with their diagnostic text; native bridge failures may throw. Updates run through the ACP bridge or LSP writethrough, so configured formatting can change the persisted text. A newly introduced syntax parse failure does not roll back the edit: it produces a warning, or an additional repair note when `edit.autoRepair.enabled` successfully repairs it.

The streaming renderer parses complete portions of an in-flight payload and computes read-only diffs. Streaming preview skips transient unresolved blocks, stale tags, and empty pastes rather than presenting partial input as a final failure. Execution re-reads and validates normally.

For multi-section calls, every section is parsed and prepared before writes begin so syntax, anchor, and no-op failures fail fast. Files then write in order; an operating-system write failure can leave the already-landed prefix applied. Named-register session state is advanced only for that landed prefix.

## Limits and validation

- Snapshot tags are four uppercase hexadecimal characters derived from normalized file content and recorded in the session snapshot store.
- `read`/`grep` exposure matters: with `edit.enforceSeenLines=true` (default), edits targeting lines outside recorded visible ranges are rejected. Re-read elided or undisplayed ranges before editing them.
- Ranges are inclusive, must be ordered, and are bounded by a parser amplification limit of 100,000 expanded lines before the target file's actual bounds are checked.
- Conflicting overlapping ranges are rejected. Exact repeated replacement ranges can coalesce to the later body with a warning; author one final-content hunk per range.
- Same-path sections are merged so their original line anchors apply together. Clipboard operations are rejected if interleaved same-path sections would make authored register order ambiguous.
- Stale tags attempt snapshot-based recovery. Recovery applies only when the recorded snapshot chain proves a unique safe result; otherwise a mismatch with current context is returned.
- A single-section byte-identical edit returns a no-change diagnostic without writing; the third consecutive identical no-op is an error. In multi-section calls, any no-op rejects the batch before writes.
- `edit.blockAutoGenerated=true` (default) rejects files recognized as generated. Plan mode permits updates only within writable roots and refuses all deletes/moves.
- A target that is not a regular file (FIFO, socket, character or block device, including through a symlink) is refused in every mode: reading it in-process can block forever or never end.
- File-backed mutable internal URLs can be edited. Read-only schemes and handler-owned writes (`agent://`, `proc://`, etc.) are refused; use `write` for those handlers. Partial/line selectors are not edit targets.
- Approval uses the strictest write tier among all targets and move destinations.

## Common failures

- Missing/malformed `[PATH#TAG]`, unknown snapshot tag, or a path that no longer exists.
- Anchor outside the file, outside the recorded seen-line ranges, in an elided region, or based on a stale snapshot that cannot be recovered safely.
- Reversed or overlapping ranges.
- Empty body for a body-backed `PUT`, body rows under a bodyless operation, unknown named register, or anonymous paste before an unambiguous anonymous cut.
- Block anchor on an unsupported/invalid syntax tree, blank/closing line, or single-line node.
- Unified-diff contamination (`@@`, apply-patch sentinels, `-old` rows) instead of hashline operations and final-content `+` rows.
- `REM` / `MV` conflicts, invalid or same-source move destinations, or filesystem write failures.
- A no-change section in a multi-section batch, or the third consecutive identical single-section no-op.
- Non-regular target: `Cannot edit '<path>': it is a <kind>, not a regular file or directory.`

The parser has limited recovery for common model slips (optional envelope, benign header noise, some bare rows and range spellings), and surfaces warnings when it repairs input. Callers SHOULD emit only the canonical grammar above; recovery behavior is not a second public syntax.

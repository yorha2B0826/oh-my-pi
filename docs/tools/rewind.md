# rewind

> End an active checkpoint by pruning exploratory context and retaining a concise report.

## Source
- Entry: `packages/coding-agent/src/tools/checkpoint.ts`
- Model-facing prompt: `packages/coding-agent/src/prompts/tools/rewind.md`
- Key collaborators:
  - `packages/coding-agent/src/session/agent-session.ts` — validates pending rewind state, applies the actual rewind, and injects the retained report.
  - `packages/coding-agent/src/session/session-manager.ts` — branches the persisted session tree and appends persisted summary/report entries.
  - `packages/coding-agent/src/session/session-context.ts` — `buildSessionContext()` converts persisted `branch_summary` entries into LLM-visible `branchSummary` messages on rebuilt context.
  - `packages/coding-agent/src/tools/index.ts` — registers the tool and shares the `checkpoint.enabled` gate.

## Registration / Visibility
- Tool metadata: `approval = "read"`, `strict = true`, `loadMode = "discoverable"`. Execution is single-shot; rewind side effects are deferred rather than streamed as progress updates.
- Registration requires `checkpoint.enabled = true` (default `false`).
- Top-level sessions receive the tool when enabled. Subagents do not discover it by default, but may receive it through an explicit `tools:`/requested-tools list.
- `checkpoint` and `rewind` are a safety pair: explicitly requesting either while the feature is enabled automatically includes the other.
- In an ordinary `tools.xdev` session, discoverable built-ins may be presented as `xd://rewind`; an explicitly requested tool remains top-level.

## Inputs

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `report` | `string` | Yes | Investigation findings. `execute()` trims it and rejects the empty result. |

## Outputs
The tool returns a single text result plus structured details:

- text body:
  - `Rewind requested.`
  - `Report captured for context replacement.`
- `details`:
  - `report: string` — trimmed report text
  - `rewound: true`

The returned tool result is not the final rewind. `AgentSession` waits until `turn_end`, then applies the rewind side effects asynchronously.

## Flow
1. Tool registration in `packages/coding-agent/src/tools/index.ts` enforces `checkpoint.enabled` and the top-level/explicit-subagent visibility rules. `RewindTool.createIf()` itself always constructs the tool.
2. Without an active checkpoint, `execute()` distinguishes two states:
   - a retained completed rewind exists: `ToolError("Checkpoint already completed; continue from the retained rewind report instead of calling rewind again.")`
   - no completed rewind exists: `ToolError("No active checkpoint. Create a checkpoint before calling rewind.")`
3. It trims `params.report`; if empty, it throws `ToolError("Report cannot be empty.")`.
4. It returns a `toolResult()` with `details.report` and `details.rewound = true`.
5. On the successful rewind tool result, `AgentSession` extracts the report from `details.report` or the first text content block and stores it in `#pendingRewindReport`.
6. At `turn_end`, `#extractRewindReport()` finds the pending or successful rewind result and calls `#applyRewind()`.
7. `#applyRewind()` first calls `sessionManager.branchWithSummary(checkpointEntryId, report, { startedAt })`, recording a `branch_summary` at the checkpoint branch point. If that entry no longer resolves, it logs a warning and branches from root instead.
8. It appends a hidden persisted `rewind-report` custom message. Its content is rendered from `prompts/system/rewind-report.md`, which tells the next turn that the checkpoint completed, not to call `rewind` again, and includes the report; details contain `{ report, startedAt, rewoundAt }`.
9. It reparents completed sibling tool calls and results from the same assistant batch onto the retained branch (excluding `rewind`, including write-device dispatches). It sets `#lastCompletedRewind`, rebuilds display/LLM context, and replaces the active messages. Earlier exploration and the successful rewind tool result are absent from the next provider call; completed sibling work remains visible and persists across resume.
10. It resets advisor session state while preserving cost, synchronizes todo and model-mention state from the new branch, and closes provider sessions whose history was rewritten.
11. Finally it clears `#checkpointState` and `#pendingRewindReport`. On later resume or tree navigation, the persisted retained report rehydrates `#lastCompletedRewind`.

## Modes / Variants
- Normal rewind: checkpoint entry exists; session history branches from that exact entry.
- Fallback rewind: checkpoint entry ID is missing from the current session tree; rewind branches from root and logs a warning.
- Deferred turn-end apply: the tool result only requests rewind; branching and context replacement happen after the surrounding assistant turn finishes.
- Resumed checkpoint: an unfinished successful checkpoint tool result on the active persisted branch rehydrates the checkpoint state, allowing rewind after process resume.

## Side Effects
- Session state (transcript, memory, jobs, checkpoints, registries)
  - Rebuilds active conversation history from the checkpoint branch plus the retained summary/report; it does not restore files or process state.
  - Adds a hidden custom message `rewind-report` carrying rendered recovery guidance and the report.
  - Records `#lastCompletedRewind`, clears the active checkpoint and pending report, resets advisors, resynchronizes todo state, and closes provider sessions invalidated by the history rewrite.
  - Repositions the persisted session leaf to the checkpoint branch point and appends new session entries.
- Filesystem
  - Persists the new `branch_summary` and `custom_message` entries into the session `.jsonl` file through normal `SessionManager` append persistence.
  - Session files are named `<ISO-timestamp-with-:-and-.-replaced>_<uuidv7>.jsonl` in the session directory; default directory selection is `~/.omp/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/` when no override is passed.
- User-visible prompts / interactive UI
  - The tool result is visible before turn-end application.
  - The persisted `branch_summary` becomes an LLM-visible `branchSummary` message when context is rebuilt; compaction rendering presents it as a user-role `<summary>` block.
  - The hidden `rewind-report` custom message becomes developer-role retained guidance for the next provider call.
- Background work / cancellation
  - Rewind application is deferred to `turn_end`. There is no separate job object or cancel handle.

## Limits & Caps
- Availability is gated by `checkpoint.enabled`, default `false`.
- Subagents require an explicit requested-tools entry; requesting either checkpoint tool auto-includes its sister.
- A session has at most one active checkpoint; there is no path to name or choose among multiple checkpoints.
- Report text must be non-empty after `trim()`.
- Rewind restores only active conversation/session-tree context; there is no file, artifact, blob, process, or git restore path.
- Persisted report/summary content is subject to the global session persistence cap `MAX_PERSIST_CHARS = 500_000`.

## Errors
- `ToolError("Checkpoint already completed; continue from the retained rewind report instead of calling rewind again.")` — thrown when the active branch already contains the retained completion.
- `ToolError("No active checkpoint. Create a checkpoint before calling rewind.")` — thrown when neither an active checkpoint nor a completed rewind is present.
- `ToolError("Report cannot be empty.")` — thrown when the trimmed report is empty.
- Missing checkpoint entry IDs during apply do not fail the completed tool call; `#applyRewind()` logs `Rewind branch checkpoint missing, falling back to root` and branches from root.

## Notes
- Checkpoint selection is implicit. `rewind` always targets the single `#checkpointState` captured or rehydrated from the last unfinished successful `checkpoint`; there is no checkpoint list, label, or ID parameter.
- Restored state is active conversation/session-tree context:
  - persisted branch reset to `checkpointEntryId` or root fallback
  - branch summary of the abandoned exploratory path
  - retained `rewind-report` custom message
  - rebuilt in-memory messages from that branch
- Not restored:
  - filesystem or git state
  - artifacts under `packages/coding-agent/src/session/artifacts.ts`
  - blob-store payloads under `packages/coding-agent/src/session/blob-store.ts`
  - prompt history rows in `packages/coding-agent/src/session/history-storage.ts`
  - auth or other agent storage in `packages/coding-agent/src/session/agent-storage.ts`
- There is no concurrent-edit reconciliation. Rewind neither merges nor reverts code or session-adjacent external state.
- Rewind is not destructive to persisted session history. `branchWithSummary()` appends a new `branch_summary` entry and moves the leaf; abandoned entries remain in the `.jsonl` log but leave the active branch.

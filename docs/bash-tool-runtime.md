# Bash tool runtime

This document describes the **`bash` tool** runtime path used by agent tool calls, from command normalization to execution, truncation/artifacts, and rendering.

It also calls out where behavior diverges in interactive TUI, print mode, RPC mode, and user-initiated bang (`!`) shell execution.

## Scope and runtime surfaces

There are two different bash execution surfaces in coding-agent:

1. **Tool-call surface** (`toolName: "bash"`): used when the model calls the bash tool.
   - Entry point: `BashTool.execute()`.
   - Parameters include `command`, optional `env`, `timeout`, `cwd`, `pty`, and, when `async.enabled` is true, `async`.
2. **User bang-command surface** (`!cmd` from interactive input or RPC `bash` command): session-level helper path.
   - Entry point: `AgentSession.executeBash()`.

Both eventually use `executeBash()` in `src/exec/bash-executor.ts` for non-PTY execution, but only the tool-call path runs normalization/interception, optional managed background-job handling, and tool renderer logic.

Set `bash.enabled: false` in settings to remove the model-facing `bash` tool from the active tool registry. This does not disable user-initiated bang commands or RPC `bash` requests.

## End-to-end tool-call pipeline

## 1) Input handling and parameter merge

`BashTool.execute()` currently handles input as follows:

- validates optional `env` names against shell-variable syntax,
- extracts a leading single-line `cd <path> && ...` into `cwd` when `cwd` was not supplied, unless the path needs shell expansion,
- rejects `async: true` when `async.enabled` is false,
- defaults `timeout` to 300 seconds; `0` explicitly disables the command deadline.

There are no structured `head` or `tail` parameters. Before execution, internal URLs in the command and environment values are expanded to backing filesystem paths; an internal URL used as `cwd` is also resolved. Expansion can create parent directories for writable `local://` paths. The configured direnv/devenv preflight can then merge project environment changes, with explicit `env` values taking precedence.

### Approval policy

The bash tool has the `exec` approval tier. `bash.patterns` rules can explicitly `allow`, `deny`, or `prompt`: deny/prompt rules match the complete command or a tokenized compound-command segment, while allow rules must match the entire command and never allow shell-control syntax. A fixed set of critical destructive and remote-fetch-and-execute patterns always forces exec approval even if a user allow rule matched. Interception and approval are separate mechanisms: interception routes misuse toward dedicated tools; approval governs whether execution may proceed.

These rules govern the **`bash` tool only**. They do not constrain shells started through other tools — notably `eval`, which can spawn a shell via subprocess (`subprocess.run(["bash", "-c", ...])`, `Bun.$`, etc.). A `bash.patterns` `deny` rule therefore does nothing when the same command is issued through `eval`. To harden against destructive commands across both surfaces, pair `bash.patterns` with a `tools.approval.eval` policy (`prompt` or `deny`); see [Tool approval mode](./approval-mode.md).

## 2) Optional interception (blocked-command path)

If `bashInterceptor.enabled` is true, `BashTool` loads rules from settings (`getBashInterceptorRules()`) and runs `checkBashInterception()` against the command — checking both the original and the cwd-normalized form (after a leading `cd … &&` is extracted) when they differ. Rule syntax is unchanged: each rule checks the complete input first, then raw flat command fragments separated by unquoted/unescaped `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, `|&`, `&`, or newlines, then those fragments with leading `NAME=value` assignments removed. Fragments that receive piped stdin from `|` or `|&` are excluded from the fragment candidates, including across blank/comment continuation lines, because a stdin-consuming stage cannot be replaced by a path-based dedicated tool.

Interception behavior:

- command is blocked **only** when:
  - regex rule matches, and
  - the suggested tool is present in `ctx.toolNames`.
- invalid regex rules are silently skipped.
- on block, `BashTool` throws `ToolError` with message:
  - `Blocked: ...`
  - original command included.
- heredocs, parameter expansion, command substitutions, backticks, grouping, and malformed quoting do not produce extra fragments; they retain only the complete-input check. Interception is best-effort routing to dedicated tools, not a shell-security policy.

Default rule patterns (defined in code) target common misuses:

- file readers (`cat`, `head`, `tail`, ...)
- search tools (`grep`, `rg`, ...)
- file finders (`find`, `fd`, ...)
- in-place editors (`sed -i`, `perl -i`, `awk -i inplace`)
- shell redirection writes (`echo ... > file`, heredoc redirection)

### Caveat

`InterceptionResult` includes `suggestedTool`, but `BashTool` currently surfaces only the message text (no structured suggested-tool field in `details`).

## 3) CWD validation and timeout resolution

`cwd` is resolved relative to session cwd (`resolveToCwd`), then validated via `stat`:

- missing path -> `ToolError("Working directory does not exist: ...")`
- non-directory -> `ToolError("Working directory is not a directory: ...")`

The default timeout is 300 seconds. `timeout: 0` disables the deadline. Other values are clamped to `[1, 3600]` seconds and by a positive `tools.maxTimeout` ceiling; a clamp notice and both requested/resolved values are recorded when they differ.

## 4) Artifact allocation

Before execution, the tool allocates an artifact path/id (best-effort) for truncated output storage.

- artifact allocation failure is non-fatal (execution continues without artifact spill file),
- artifact id/path are passed into execution path for full-output persistence on truncation.

## 5) PTY vs non-PTY execution selection

PTY eligibility is decided by `canUseInteractiveBashPty(pty, ctx)` (`src/tools/bash-pty-selection.ts`); the local PTY overlay runs only when all are true:

- tool input `pty === true`
- `PI_NO_PTY !== "1"`
- tool context has UI (`ctx.hasUI === true` and `ctx.ui` set)

If `pty` is requested but unavailable, the call falls back to non-PTY and appends a `pty requested but unavailable …` notice.

Before the local PTY/non-PTY choice, a foreground (`async: false`) call can route to a managed background job (auto-backgrounding; see below) or — when the session's client advertises a terminal capability (`clientBridge.capabilities.terminal` + `createTerminal`, with `pty` false) — to a **client-bridge editor terminal** that runs the command remotely (streaming `terminalId` updates, killing on timeout, mapping a signal kill to exit code `137`). Otherwise it uses non-interactive `executeBash()`.

That means print mode and non-UI RPC/tool contexts always use non-PTY.

## Non-interactive execution engine (`executeBash`)

## Shell session reuse model

`executeBash()` caches native `Shell` instances in a process-global map keyed by:

- shell path,
- configured command prefix,
- snapshot path,
- serialized shell env,
- optional agent session key,
- minimizer configuration.

Session-level bang-command executions pass `sessionKey: this.sessionId`.

Tool-call executions pass `sessionKey: this.session.getSessionId?.()`, when available. In both surfaces, a session key isolates shell reuse per session; without one, reuse falls back to shell config/snapshot/env.
Concurrent calls never share one `Shell`: the native session runs one command at a time and `Shell.abort()` kills every in-flight run on it. `executeBash()` tracks in-flight keys in `shellSessionsInUse`; while a key is busy, overlapping calls skip the cache and run through one-shot `executeShell()` (same isolation as quarantined sessions). Only the owning call releases the in-use flag or deletes the cached session in its `finally`.

## Bundled `jq` compatibility

Unless `PI_DISABLE_UUTILS_BUILTINS` is truthy, the non-PTY native shell registers a bundled `jq` command backed by vendored [jaq](https://github.com/01mf02/jaq), not the system `jq`. Setting that flag disables the in-process uutils command set and falls back to system binaries. The bundled jaq errors when chained access indexes through a null or missing intermediate: `.a.b` over `{}` exits 5, whereas jq returns `null`.

Guard the access with `[.a.b?][0]` when the parent may be null or absent. The `?` suppresses jaq's traversal error (jq never raises it), and `[…][0]` maps the suppressed empty output to `null` while preserving a legitimate `false` or `null` value:

```jq
{"c": [.a.b?][0]}
```

Avoid the naive `.a.b? // null`: `//` treats a legitimate `false` (and `null`) as absent, so it silently rewrites boolean data to the fallback. It also diverges on parse — `{"c": .a.b? // null}` is accepted by jaq but is a syntax error in jq (the value needs parentheses: `{"c": (.a.b? // null)}`).

## Shell config, direnv, and snapshot behavior

At each call, the executor loads settings shell config (`shell`, `env`, optional `prefix`) and runs `applyDirenvPreflight()`.

Unless `bash.direnv` is `"off"`, preflight attempts to load the cwd's direnv/devenv changes within `bash.direnvLoadTimeoutMs`, additionally bounded by a positive command timeout. Direnv-provided variables are merged below explicit caller `env`; safe variables removed by direnv are prepended as `unset -v ...`. ACP-terminal and PTY routes run the same preflight before their backend; the non-PTY executor runs it internally.

If the selected shell includes `bash`, it attempts `getOrCreateSnapshot()`:

- snapshot captures aliases/functions/options from user rc,
- snapshot creation is best-effort,
- failure falls back to no snapshot.

If `prefix` is configured, it wraps the command after any direnv unset prefix.

The per-command child environment is then built by `buildNonInteractiveEnv()` (`src/exec/non-interactive-env.ts`), which layers non-interactive hardening defaults **under** the caller and direnv overrides:

- pagers disabled (`PAGER=cat`, `GIT_PAGER=cat`, … and `LESS=FRX`),
- editor prompts disabled (`GIT_EDITOR=true`, `EDITOR=true`, `VISUAL=true`),
- terminal/credential prompts reduced (`TERM=dumb`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `SSH_ASKPASS=/usr/bin/false`, `NO_COLOR=1`, `CI=true` unless `PI_BASH_NO_CI`/`CLAUDE_BASH_NO_CI` is set),
- package-manager/tooling automation flags for non-interactive behavior (npm/pnpm/yarn/pip/cargo/terraform/gh, …),
- on Windows, UTF-8 locale/codepage defaults are added when absent.

## Streaming and cancellation

`Shell.run()` streams chunks to `OutputSink` and optional `onChunk` callback.

Cancellation:

- aborted signal triggers `shellSession.abort(...)`,
- timeout from native result is mapped to `cancelled: true` + annotation text,
- explicit cancellation similarly returns `cancelled: true` + annotation.

No exception is thrown inside executor for timeout/cancel; it returns structured `BashResult` and lets caller map error semantics.

## Interactive PTY path (`runInteractiveBashPty`)

When PTY is enabled, tool runs `runInteractiveBashPty()` which opens an overlay console component and drives a native `PtySession`.

Behavior highlights:

- xterm-headless virtual terminal renders viewport in overlay,
- keyboard input is normalized (including Kitty sequences and application cursor mode handling),
- `esc` while running kills the PTY session,
- terminal resize propagates to PTY (`session.resize(cols, rows)`).

Unlike the non-PTY engine, the interactive PTY path does **not** apply the non-interactive hardening. It inherits the user's environment and sets a real `TERM=xterm-256color` (applied as an override on the Rust side) so editors, pagers, and TUIs behave like a normal terminal.

PTY output is normalized (`CRLF`/`CR` to `LF`, `sanitizeText`) and written into `OutputSink`, including artifact spill support.

On PTY startup/runtime error, sink receives `PTY error: ...` line and command finalizes with undefined exit code.

## Output handling: streaming, truncation, artifact spill

Both PTY and non-PTY paths use `OutputSink`.

## OutputSink semantics

The bash executor builds the sink with `headBytes` and `maxColumns` from settings (`resolveOutputSinkHeadBytes` / `resolveOutputMaxColumns`).

- keeps a UTF-8-safe rolling **tail** window (`spillThreshold`, `DEFAULT_MAX_BYTES`, currently 50KB); on overflow it trims to the tail (UTF-8 boundary safe) and marks `truncated`,
- when `headBytes > 0` (`tools.artifactHeadBytes`, default 20KB) it also retains a **head** window and elides the middle, splicing an elision marker between head and tail in `dump()`,
- per-line column cap: when `maxColumns > 0` (`tools.outputMaxColumns`, default 768 bytes) over-wide lines are ellipsis-truncated at write time and the rest of the line is dropped,
- tracks total bytes/lines seen,
- mirrors the **raw, uncapped** stream to the artifact file when output overflows, a column cap dropped bytes, or the file is already active,
- marks `truncated` on tail overflow, middle elision, column-cap drops, or file spill.

`dump()` returns:

- `output` (possibly annotated prefix),
- `truncated`,
- `totalLines/totalBytes`,
- `outputLines/outputBytes`,
- `elidedBytes/elidedLines` when the middle was elided,
- `columnDroppedBytes/columnTruncatedLines` when the per-line cap fired,
- `artifactId` if artifact file was active.

### Long-output caveat

Runtime truncation is byte-threshold based in `OutputSink` (50KB tail window by default, plus an optional head window for middle elision). It does not enforce a hard line-count cap in this code path.

### Shell output minimizer

Non-PTY execution also passes shell-minimizer settings into the native `Shell` session. When the minimizer rewrites verbose output, the executor replaces the sink's visible text with the minimized text and, when possible, saves the raw original capture as a separate `bash-original` artifact referenced by a `[raw output: artifact://<id>]` footer.

## Live tool updates and async jobs

For non-PTY foreground execution, `BashTool` uses a separate `TailBuffer` for partial updates and emits `onUpdate` snapshots while command is running.

For PTY execution, live rendering is handled by custom UI overlay, not by `onUpdate` text chunks.

When `async.enabled` is true and the call passes `async: true`, `BashTool` starts a managed bash job immediately, returns a running result with a job id, and stores completion through the session job manager. Auto-backgrounding can also use this path after `bash.autoBackground.thresholdMs`; it is skipped for PTY and client-bridge terminal routes and falls back to foreground execution when the job manager is at capacity. A queued steering message can background a still-running auto-background candidate early.

## Result shaping, metadata, and error mapping

After execution:

1. A cancellation or missing exit status throws a tool error. The client-bridge
   terminal route also throws `ToolError` for timeout before structured result
   shaping.
2. Local non-PTY and interactive-PTY timeouts return an error result with
   `details.timedOut = true` so the renderer can distinguish them from an
   ordinary failure.
3. Empty output becomes `(no output)`.
4. A final inline byte cap protects routes that bypass `OutputSink`; it reuses the sink artifact when available or saves a `bash-original` artifact.
5. Truncation metadata is attached from the sink summary.
6. A nonzero exit returns an error result with `details.exitCode`; zero returns success.

Result details can also include resolved/requested timeout, `timeoutDisabled`, client `terminalId`, wall time, async job state, and truncation metadata. Truncation includes direction/reason, total and shown line/byte counts, shown range, and `artifactId` when persistence succeeded.

Built-in tool wrapping appends the model-facing recovery notice automatically, for example `Read artifact://<id> for full output`.

## Rendering paths

## Tool-call renderer (`bashToolRenderer`)

`bashToolRenderer` is used for tool-call messages (`toolCall` / `toolResult`):

- collapsed mode shows visual-line-truncated preview,
- expanded mode shows all currently available output text,
- warning line includes truncation reason and `artifact://<id>` when truncated,
- timeout value (from args) is shown in footer metadata line.

### Caveat: full artifact expansion

`BashRenderContext` has `isFullOutput`, but current renderer context builder does not set it for bash tool results. Expanded view still uses the text already in result content (tail/truncated output) unless another caller provides full artifact content.

## User bang-command component (`BashExecutionComponent`)

`BashExecutionComponent` is for user `!` commands in interactive mode (not model tool calls):

- streams chunks live,
- collapsed preview keeps last 20 logical lines,
- line clamp at 4000 chars per line,
- shows truncation + artifact warnings when metadata is present,
- marks cancelled/error/exit state separately.

This component is wired by `CommandController.handleBashCommand()` and fed from `AgentSession.executeBash()`.

## Mode-specific behavior differences

## Operational caveats

- Interceptor only blocks commands when suggested tool is currently available in context.
- If artifact allocation fails, truncation still occurs but no `artifact://` back-reference is available.
- Shell session cache has no explicit eviction in this module; lifetime is process-scoped.
- Timeout shaping is backend-specific: local non-PTY and interactive-PTY timeouts return error results with `details.timedOut`; the client-bridge terminal creation/execution timeout paths throw `ToolError`. Non-timeout cancellations throw across these tool-call routes.

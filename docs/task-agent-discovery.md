# Task Agent Discovery and Selection

This document describes how the task subsystem discovers agent definitions, merges multiple sources, and resolves a requested agent at execution time.

It covers runtime behavior as implemented today, including precedence, invalid-definition handling, and spawn/depth constraints that can make an agent effectively unavailable.

## Agent definition shape

Task agents normalize into `AgentDefinition` (`src/task/types.ts`):

- required `name`, `description`, and `systemPrompt`
- optional `tools`, `spawns`, prioritized `model` list, `thinkingLevel`, `output`, `blocking`, `autoloadSkills`, `readSummarize`, `prewalk`, `advisor`
- `source`: `"bundled" | "user" | "project"` (extension agents are tagged with their extension root's project/user level)
- optional `filePath`

Parsing comes from frontmatter via `parseAgentFields()` (`src/discovery/helpers.ts`):

- missing/non-string `name` or `description` => invalid (`null`), caller treats as parse failure
- `main` and `sub` are reserved names (checked after trimming and lowercasing); definitions using them are invalid
- `tools` accepts CSV or array; legacy tool aliases are normalized and `yield` is auto-added. An explicit `tools: []` therefore grants `yield`, not the default toolset.
- `spawns` accepts `*`, CSV, or array
- backward-compat behavior: if `spawns` missing but `tools` includes `task`, `spawns` becomes `*`
- `output` is passed through as opaque schema data
- `read-summarize: false` (normalized to `readSummarize`) disables structural summaries for the subagent's `read` tool — `runSubprocess` applies a `read.summarize.enabled: false` override on the child's isolated settings (`src/task/executor.ts`). `scout` ships with it disabled. When absent, the child inherits the parent's read-summary setting.
- `model` accepts one selector, CSV, or an array. Entries are tried in order after role aliases are expanded.
- `thinking-level` / `thinking` selects the agent's configured effort. When `task.enableEffort` (default `false`) exposes it, a task item's coarse `effort` (`lo`, `med`, `hi`) takes precedence at launch. OMP maps that hint to the selected model's lowest, middle, or highest supported effort, then clamps it to `task.maxEffort` (default `max`). The ceiling is carried across retry-fallback model switches. If the selected model has no supported effort at or below the ceiling, the spawn fails; models without a controllable effort surface instead fall back to their normal selector.
- `blocking: true` makes the parent wait for that agent even when async task execution is enabled
- `autoloadSkills` names skills from the parent session to inject before the first child prompt; unknown names are ignored
- `prewalk: true` starts the subagent on its resolved model and hands off to the default prewalk target (the `smol` role) at its first edit/write, exactly like the session-level `--prewalk`; a string value (e.g. `prewalk: "@smol"` or `prewalk: "openai/gpt-5-mini"`) picks a custom target. The `task.agentPrewalk` settings record (agent name → `"on"` / `"off"` / pattern, configured per agent from the `/agents` hub via its prewalk strip) overrides the frontmatter. Resolution happens in `runSubprocess` (`src/task/executor.ts`). An unavailable target is skipped instead of failing the spawn. A resolved target is skipped only when both its model identity and its effective thinking mode/level match the starting selection after model clamping; a same-model effort downgrade is a real hand-off and still arms and switches at the first edit/write.
- `advisor: true` pairs spawned sessions of the agent with an advisor running the model resolved for the `advisor` role; a string value (e.g. `advisor: "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash"` or `advisor: "@smol:high"`) sets an explicit advisor model pattern (optional `:level` suffix), applied as the spawned session's `modelRoles.advisor`. The `task.agentAdvisor` settings record (agent name → `"on"` / `"off"` / pattern, configured per agent from the `/agents` hub via its advisor strip) overrides the frontmatter. Resolution happens in `runSubprocess` (`src/task/executor.ts`); subagents default to no advisor, and the effective opt-in is persisted in `session_init` so cold revival restores it.

## Role-backed custom agents

OMP discovers user agents from `~/.omp/agent/agents/*.md` and project agents from `.omp/agents/*.md`.

Give the agent a role alias in frontmatter, then dispatch it by name. For model routing, task dispatch sets only `agent`; it does not set a worker model:

`~/.omp/agent/agents/reviewer.md`:

```md
---
name: reviewer
description: Review a change for correctness.
model: "@review"
---

Review the assigned change and report concrete findings.
```

Set the role mapping in `~/.omp/agent/config.yml`:

```yaml
modelRoles:
  review: openai/gpt-5.4:high
```

`@review` resolves through `modelRoles.review`. Each `modelRoles.<role>` value stores a concrete model selector and may append a thinking suffix such as `:high` (`src/config/model-resolver.ts`). Changing that mapping affects subsequent task resolutions without editing agent definitions. Task/eval preflight reloads the current global, project, and explicit overlay settings before rediscovering agents, so agent files and their role aliases added during a live session resolve from one refreshed configuration state.

With the default batched task schema, supply shared `context` and per-item `task` and `solutionSpace`. `solutionSpace` describes how open-ended the assignment is, rather than its size. Set `agent` only when choosing a non-default agent:

```json
{
  "context": "Review the current change in this repository.",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "agent": "reviewer",
      "task": "Report concrete correctness findings.",
      "solutionSpace": "Review cause and failure modes are open; no known defect."
    }
  ]
}
```

`/model`'s Roles view can assign and persist custom role mappings such as `review`, `fast`, and `good`. Changing only the active or default session selection does not remap those roles.

## User-tagged model agents

Type `^` in the composer to choose a model from the same scope and ranking as the `Alt+P` session picker. Accepting a completion inserts an atomic chip showing its display name. For example, type `Have ^`, pick a model, then finish with `review this change`.

On submit, each first-mentioned model receives a branch-local pseudonym (`m1`, `m2`, …). The user message carries `<model agent="m1" name="Display Name"/>`; the task description lists its provider/model selector. `task`, eval `agent()`, and `workpool()` accept that pseudonym as their `agent`. These agents use the bundled general-purpose task template, not a specialist template, and are intended only for requests explicitly naming the tagged model.

Tagging a model never rewrites the model-facing `task` description mid-session: the description lists the pseudonyms baked into the current base prompt, and later tags arrive as a hidden `session-agents` system notice on the next user turn. The notice rides the same channel as the eval-prelude and tool-roster deltas, so the provider cache prefix stays byte-stable. The next base-prompt rebuild absorbs the live set into the description.

Pseudonyms survive `/resume`; rewinding before a model's first mention frees its number. Repeating a selector reuses its pseudonym. Unknown selectors remain literal, as do mentions in `!`/`$` local-execution drafts. Tokens require whitespace boundaries: autocomplete adds the trailing space. When two models share a display name in one draft, the second remains a literal selector to avoid ambiguous expansion.

Session definitions are appended after discovered agents, so an existing agent with the same name wins. Normal spawn restrictions and model-override precedence still apply. Synthetic prompts cannot register models.

## Watch running agents

After dispatch, press `Alt+A` to open [Agent Hub](./agent-hub.md). Its live roster shows each task agent's status, current activity, model, age, and usage. Select an agent to read its transcript and steer it directly; parked agents can be revived from the same view. Enable `tui.mouse` to click live task cards and jump-list rows instead, or watch the pinned `Subagents` block above the editor.

### `vibe_spawn` tier routing

`vibe_spawn` maps `fast` to bundled `sonic` and `good` to bundled `task`. Both resolve through `task.agentModelOverrides` before their bundled agent model defaults (`src/vibe/runtime.ts`, `src/task/agents.ts`).

Route these tiers through roles by keeping aliases in `task.agentModelOverrides` and concrete selectors only in `modelRoles`:

```yaml
task:
  agentModelOverrides:
    sonic: "@fast_worker"
    task: "@good_worker"
modelRoles:
  fast_worker: openai/gpt-5-mini
  good_worker: openai/gpt-5.4:high
```

The `vibe_spawn` `cli` remains `fast` or `good`; update `modelRoles` to change the worker model.

## Bundled agents

Bundled agents are embedded at build time (`src/task/agents.ts`) using text imports.

`EMBEDDED_AGENT_DEFS` defines:

- `scout`, `reviewer`, and `security-reviewer` from prompt files
- `task` and `sonic` from the shared `task.md` body plus injected frontmatter; no bundled agent sets `prewalk` — the generic `task` agent's hand-off is armed by the `task.prewalk` setting (default off), or per agent via `/agents` / `task.agentPrewalk` / user agent frontmatter

Loading path:

1. `loadBundledAgents()` parses embedded markdown with `parseAgent(..., "bundled", "fatal")`
2. results are cached in-memory (`bundledAgentsCache`)
3. `clearBundledAgentsCache()` is test-only cache reset

Because bundled parsing uses `level: "fatal"`, unrecoverable YAML errors or invalid required fields throw and can fail discovery entirely.

## Filesystem and plugin discovery

`discoverAgents(cwd, home, extensionRoots?)` (`src/task/discovery.ts`) merges agents from OMP-native roots, OMP extension packages, and Claude marketplace plugin roots before appending bundled definitions. Direct cross-harness roots such as `.claude/agents`, `.codex/agents`, and `.gemini/agents` are intentionally skipped — their frontmatter schema is not the OMP task-agent contract (`TASK_AGENT_CONFIG_SOURCE = ".omp"` filters the native config-dir lists).

### Discovery inputs and precedence

1. Nearest project `.omp/agents` dir from `findAllNearestProjectConfigDirs("agents", cwd)` (first `.omp` hit only)
2. User `.omp/agents` dir from `getConfigDirs("agents", { project: false })` (first `.omp` hit only)
3. `<extension-root>/agents` for every enabled OMP extension package returned by `listOmpExtensionRoots(...)`, in this order:
   - explicit CLI `--extension` / SDK `additionalExtensionPaths` directory roots
   - the session's effective `extensions:` array, in its configured order
   - installed npm/link plugins
   Project and user `extensions:` arrays are not concatenated: settings use array-replacement precedence. Session overlays/runtime overrides and the configured array's project/user provenance are preserved. In `explicit-only` mode (`--no-extensions` or SDK `disableExtensionDiscovery`), only explicit roots contribute this package surface; file entrypoints have no `agents/` subdirectory to scan.
4. Claude marketplace plugin roots (`listClaudePluginRoots(home, cwd)`) with `agents/` subdirs — only when `isProviderEnabled("claude-plugins")`; project-scope plugins sort before user-scope. User-scope roots additionally require the `claude-plugins` or `claude` user source to be enabled (`isUserSourceEnabled`: normally via `enabledProviders`, e.g. `["claude-plugins"]`; `claude` is also enabled implicitly when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set), except roots whose origin is not the foreign `~/.claude/plugins` tree (omp's own installs with `origin: "omp"` and `--plugin-dir` roots) — mirroring the skills path's exemption.
5. Bundled agents (`loadBundledAgents()`)

The OMP extension-package surface is disabled when the `omp-plugins` capability provider is disabled. Marketplace roots are excluded from `listOmpExtensionRoots` and enter only through the separately gated Claude-plugin path.

Claude-dialect plugin agents discard their frontmatter `model` so Claude aliases are not misread as OMP selectors. This applies to foreign Claude roots and packages whose manifest declares the Claude format, including OMP installs or `--plugin-dir` roots. OMP-native and Agent-Plugins-standard packages retain their model selectors.

## Merge and collision rules

Discovery uses first-wins dedup by exact `agent.name`:

- A `Set<string>` tracks seen names.
- Loaded agents are flattened in directory order and kept only if name unseen.
- Bundled agents are filtered against the same set and only added if still unseen.

Implications:

- Project `.omp` overrides user `.omp`.
- Earlier extension roots override later extension roots, Claude marketplace plugins, and bundled agents.
- Non-bundled agents override bundled agents with the same name.
- Name matching is case-sensitive (`Task` and `task` are distinct).
- Within one directory, markdown files are read in lexicographic filename order before dedup.

## Invalid/missing agent file behavior

Per directory (`loadAgentsFromDir`):

- unreadable/missing directory: treated as empty (`readdir(...).catch(() => [])`)
- file read or parse failure: warning logged, file skipped
- parse path uses `parseAgent(..., level: "warn")`

Frontmatter failure behavior comes from `parseFrontmatter`:

- the default lenient parser normalizes line endings and kebab-case keys, replaces tabs in YAML, and can repair ambiguous plain scalars before reporting failure
- an unrecovered parse error at `warn` level logs a warning, then falls back to top-level `key: value` lines
- fallback values are individually parsed as YAML when possible, preserving scalar/array types
- if required fields remain invalid, `parseAgentFields` fails, then `AgentParsingError` is thrown and caught by the directory loader (file skipped)

Net effect: one bad custom agent file does not abort discovery of other files.

## Agent lookup and selection

Lookup is exact-name linear search:

- `getAgent(agents, name)` => `agents.find(a => a.name === name)`
- unrestricted sessions default an omitted `agent` field to `task`
- a restricted parent `spawns` list defaults an omitted `agent` field to the first listed agent

`resolveEffectiveSubagentPolicy()` is shared by task and eval-backed subagent launches. Before allocating artifacts it:

1. atomically reloads the live session's persisted global, project, and explicit overlay settings while preserving runtime overrides
2. resolves the omitted or explicit agent name from the parent spawn policy
3. enforces depth, blocked-self-recursion, and parent spawn-policy guards
4. rediscovers agents with the session's cwd and effective extension-root configuration, appends user-tagged session agents, and performs exact lookup
5. checks `task.disabledAgents`
6. resolves plan-mode restrictions, output schema, model policy, and isolation policy

A missing name fails preflight with `Unknown agent "...". Available: ...`; no subprocess runs.

### Description vs execution-time discovery

`TaskTool.create()` memoizes discovery by resolved working directory plus the complete effective extension-root configuration when building the model-facing tool description. Each description read also includes the user-tagged model agents frozen into the current base prompt surface (see [user-tagged model agents](#user-tagged-model-agents)) rather than the live set, so tagging a model mid-session cannot mutate the provider tool prefix. Execution rediscovers agents and merges the live session agents, so the runtime set can differ from the earlier description if agent or extension files changed mid-session. Blocking behavior is determined after policy resolution rather than from a stale description-time agent object.

## Model and structured-output precedence

For task dispatch, model precedence is:

1. `task.agentModelOverrides[agentName]`
2. the agent frontmatter's prioritized `model` list
3. the parent's active model, then its configured/default model fallback

Role aliases in either of the first two sources are expanded through `modelRoles`. The shared eval bridge can also supply an invocation-local model override ahead of the settings override; the task wire schema does not expose that field.

After policy resolution, the `before_subagent_spawn` extension hook runs once for the actual dispatch. It can block the spawn or replace the resolved model patterns; a routing note is carried into progress metadata.

The `Alt+P` task model pick is session-only; saving a model in `/agents` replaces that runtime selection for the current session and persists the new value for future sessions.

Compaction triggers are separate from model and service-tier selection: an exact, case-sensitive
`task.agentCompactionThresholdOverrides[agentName]` entry (`90000` or `"80%"`) replaces the
`compaction.threshold*` settings for that agent only; agents without an entry, including agents it
spawns, use the main session's thresholds. See [Settings](./settings.md#context-compaction-and-memory).

Service-tier precedence is independent of model selection: an exact, case-sensitive
`task.agentServiceTierOverrides[agentName]` entry overrides `tier.subagent`; an absent entry preserves
the global behavior. `inherit` snapshots the parent session's live per-family tiers (including
`/fast` changes) for the next spawn. The child session resolves a concrete value against the model
it finally settles on — after auth fallback and after patterns only the session can resolve, such as
extension-registered models — and populates only that model's provider family when the family
supports the value, so same-family retry fallbacks retain the tier and cross-family fallbacks never
inherit it. The resolved map is persisted with the child's session, even when it is empty, so a
parked agent revived after a restart keeps its per-agent tier instead of re-deriving
`tier.subagent`. The entry is looked up by task/eval dispatch only; Vibe workers launched through
the same executor keep `tier.subagent`. Service tiers are configuration-only; agent frontmatter and
the task/eval wire formats do not expose a tier field or automatic Fast policy.

Account selection is independent of model and service-tier selection: an exact, case-sensitive
`task.agentAccountPools[agentName]` entry maps provider ids to OAuth identity keys (the `identityKey`
values broker [client account pools](./auth-broker-gateway.md#client-account-pools-routing-not-authorization)
use, such as `email:<address>|org:<id>` for Anthropic; [`omp usage accounts`](./cli-reference.md)
lists them). For each listed provider the child authenticates
only with those accounts: ranking, the parent's copied account affinity, restored pins, fallback
passes, and credential rotation stay inside the pool, and runtime, environment, and stored API keys
are not used; a `models.yml` `apiKey` for the provider fails the request instead of sending a pooled
token to that endpoint. When no pooled account can serve, the request fails with `No API key for
provider: … restricted to its OAuth account pool` instead of borrowing another account; an empty
list allows no account. Pools do not pick models, so model and retry-fallback policy still decide
which provider the child calls. The pool covers every key lookup the agent makes, whatever provider
session id it carries: fresh or reset sessions, advisors, title generation, skill compression, and
subagents it spawns without their own entry (an entry of their own replaces it). Vibe workers take
the pool from their first turn, and a parked agent revived in the same process or after a restart
takes the live entry for its agent name. A custom SDK `getApiKey` resolver bypasses pools.

Runtime output schema precedence is:

1. the task item's explicit `outputSchema`
2. agent frontmatter `output`
3. parent session `outputSchema`

The task item's optional `schemaMode` overrides the parent session mode; the default is `permissive`.

Explicit caller schemas are validated during preflight in both modes. Agent/session schemas are preflight-validated when the effective mode is `strict`. Invalid schemas fail before child execution.

The model-facing prompt (`src/prompts/tools/task.md`) tags read-only agents and warns against offloading reasoning to `scout`/`sonic`.

## Command discovery interaction

`src/task/commands.ts` is parallel infrastructure for workflow commands (not agent definitions), but it follows the same overall pattern:

- discover from capability providers first
- deduplicate by name with first-wins
- append bundled commands if still unseen
- exact-name lookup via `getCommand`

In `src/task/index.ts`, command helpers are re-exported with agent discovery helpers. Agent discovery itself does not depend on command discovery at runtime.

## Availability constraints beyond discovery

An agent can be discoverable but still unavailable to run because of execution guardrails.

### Disabled-agent settings

`resolveEffectiveSubagentPolicy()` checks `task.disabledAgents` after resolving the agent. A disabled name fails preflight and lists enabled alternatives when available.

### Parent spawn policy

The resolver checks `session.getSessionSpawns()`:

- `"*"` (also `true`, `null`, or absent) => allow any; omitted `agent` defaults to `task`
- `""` or `false` => deny all
- CSV list => allow only listed names; omitted `agent` defaults to its first name

If denied: `Cannot spawn '...'. Allowed: ...`.

### Blocked self-recursion env guard

`PI_BLOCKED_AGENT` (or the internal request override) rejects an attempt to spawn the same blocked agent before discovery.

### Recursion-depth gating

`task.maxRecursionDepth` defaults to `2`; a negative value disables the cap. The shared policy rejects a spawn when the current task depth has already reached the cap. When a child reaches the cap, `runSubprocess` also removes `task` from its tool list and sets its spawn policy empty.

For an explicit agent tool list, `runSubprocess` auto-adds `task` when `spawns` is declared and depth permits it. The legacy `exec` entry expands to `bash` plus `eval` when an eval backend is available. A list containing `task` or `bash` also gains `wait` unless the parent requires an exact restricted tool list; tool construction still omits `wait` when there is no async, IRC, or service wake source. Outbound peer messaging requires `write` in the child tool list and IRC enabled; inbound steering does not.

## Plan mode behavior

When parent plan mode is enabled, `resolveEffectiveSubagentPolicy()` builds an `effectiveAgent` before launching subprocesses:

- prepends the plan-mode subagent system prompt
- restricts tools to `read`, `grep`, `glob`, and `web_search`, plus `ast_grep` when the agent's own tool list declares it
- clears child spawns
- clears `prewalk` (read-only exploration must not receive the prewalk plan/implement nudges)

Plan mode also rejects eval-defined tools and per-spawn isolation, apply, and merge controls. The same `effectiveAgent` is used for subprocess launch, model/thinking overrides, and output-schema selection.

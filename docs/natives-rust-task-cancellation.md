# Native Rust task execution and cancellation (`pi-natives`)

This document describes how `crates/pi-natives` schedules native work and how cancellation flows from JS options (`timeoutMs`, `AbortSignal`) into Rust execution.

## Core primitives (`task.rs`)

`task.rs` defines:

1. `task::blocking(tag, cancel_token, work)`
   - Wraps `napi::AsyncTask` / `Task`.
   - `compute()` runs on libuv worker threads.
   - Returns a JS `Promise<T>` for exported functions.
   - Records a profiling sample through `profile_region(tag)`.
   - Catches worker panics at the N-API async-work FFI boundary and rejects with ``native task `<tag>` panicked: <message>``.
   - Before resolving on the JS thread, checks explicit abort-flag state again. An abort after worker completion rejects as an `AbortError`; a deadline that elapsed only while JS was busy settling a completed result does not invalidate that result.

2. `task::future(env, tag, work)`
   - Wraps `env.spawn_future(...)`.
   - Runs async work on Tokio's runtime.
   - Returns `PromiseRaw<'env, T>`.
   - Records a profiling sample through `profile_region(tag)`.

3. `CancelToken` / `AbortToken` / `AbortReason`
   - `CancelToken::new(timeout_ms, signal)` wraps the shared `pi_shell::cancel::CancelToken`, adding an optional JS `AbortSignal` bridge. Already-aborted signals set the flag immediately; invalid optional signal values are tolerated rather than rejecting the operation.
   - `CancelToken::heartbeat()` is cooperative cancellation for blocking loops.
   - `CancelToken::wait()` asynchronously waits for signal or timeout.
   - `CancelToken::abort_token()` returns an abort handle backed by the shared flag when one already exists; without a flag, the handle is inert. `emplace_abort_token()` lazily installs the flag and returns a live handle. `CancelToken::new` uses the latter to bridge a JS `AbortSignal` to `AbortReason::Signal`.
   - `CancelToken::aborted()` provides a non-blocking signal/deadline check. `abort_reason()` checks only the explicit flag, excluding deadlines; `into_core()` transfers the token to `pi-shell`.
   - `AbortToken::abort(reason)` lets external code request abort. Reasons are `Unknown`, `Timeout`, `Signal`, and `User`.

4. `task::blocking_mapped(tag, cancel_token, reject_hook, cancel_hook, work)`
   - Uses the same libuv execution/profiling and panic guard as `blocking`.
   - Converts typed domain failures into rich JS errors through `reject_hook(env, error)` on the JS thread.
   - Uses `cancel_hook(env, reason)` for explicit cancellation noticed at result settlement. Native VCS exports use this path.

## `blocking` vs `future`: execution model and selection

### Use `task::blocking`

Use when work is CPU-heavy or fundamentally synchronous/blocking:

- regex/file scanning (`grep`, `glob`, `fuzzyFind`)
- ast-grep search/edit worker work
- HTML conversion
- clipboard image read

Behavior:

- Work closure receives a cloned `CancelToken`.
- During computation, cancellation is cooperative: work must check `ct.heartbeat()?`. Result settlement additionally checks the explicit abort flag, but cannot stop uncooperative work early.
- Closure `Err(...)` rejects the JS promise.
- `blocking_mapped` is appropriate when the rejection needs a domain-specific JS error object, code, or properties.

### Use `task::future`

Use when work must `await` async operations:

- shell session orchestration (`Shell.run`, `executeShell`)
- PTY outer promise (`PtySession.start`) before it enters `spawn_blocking`
- async task orchestration that must bridge completion and cancellation

Behavior:

- Future code can race normal completion against `ct.wait()`.
- On cancel path, async implementations typically cancel subordinate machinery and may force-abort after a grace timeout.

`text.rs`, `tokens.rs`, `keys.rs`, most synchronous `ps.rs` functions, SIXEL encoding/decoding, and synchronous utility exports do not use `task::blocking`/`task::future` cancellation. The async `Process.terminate()` and `Process.waitForExit()` methods do. Other blocking conversions such as `rasterizeSvg`, `pdfToMarkdown`, `renderSnapcompactPng`, and `deviceCheckGenerateToken` use passive `()` tokens and expose no timeout/signal option.

## Cancellation lifecycle and state transitions

### `CancelToken` lifecycle

```text
Created
  ├─ no signal + no timeout  -> passive token
  ├─ signal registered        -> AbortSignal callback can set AbortReason::Signal
  └─ deadline set             -> timeout check becomes active

Running
  ├─ heartbeat()/wait() sees signal   -> AbortReason::Signal
  ├─ heartbeat()/wait() sees deadline -> AbortReason::Timeout
  └─ no abort                         -> continue

Aborted
  └─ shared flag wakes waiters; a later abort call can replace the stored reason, while a deadline is evaluated independently
```

### Before-start vs mid-execution cancellation

- **Before start / before first cancellation check**:
  - `task::future` users that race on `ct.wait()` can resolve cancellation once they enter `select!`.
  - `task::blocking` users observe cancellation at closure heartbeat checks, with an explicit-flag check again during JS result settlement. The helper itself does not insert a pre-compute heartbeat.
  - PTY checks before `openpty` and before spawn reject setup rather than returning a command cancellation result.

- **Mid-execution**:
  - `blocking`: next `heartbeat()` returns `Err("Aborted: ...")`.
  - `future`: `ct.wait()` branch wins `select!`, then code cancels subordinate async machinery.
  - shell: cancellation triggers a Tokio cancellation token and TERM/KILL waves over a per-run spawn registry, waits up to 2 seconds (5 on Windows) for the command task, then aborts the task if needed. Cleanup is scoped to that run, not a process-global descendant snapshot.
  - PTY: heartbeat failure or `kill()` terminates PTY child/process targets and drains output briefly.

## Heartbeat expectations for long-running loops

`heartbeat()` must run at predictable cadence in loops with unbounded or large work sets.

Observed patterns:

- `glob` and `fuzzyFind` pass heartbeat callbacks into `pi-walker` traversal and also check result-processing loops.
- `grep` checks before and during expensive search and passes the token through its scan/search workers.
- `run_pty_sync` checks every loop tick with a maximum 16ms wait cadence.
- `listWorkspace` checks during traversal.

Practical rule: no loop over external-size input should exceed a short bounded interval without a heartbeat.

## Failure behavior and error propagation to JS

### Blocking tasks

Error path:

1. Closure returns `Err(napi::Error)` (including `heartbeat()` abort).
2. `Task::compute()` returns `Err`.
3. `AsyncTask` rejects JS promise.

A successful worker result can still reject if the explicit abort flag was set before `resolve()` runs. That path uses `AbortError` / `Status::Cancelled`; elapsed deadlines alone are not checked at settlement. `blocking_mapped` applies its domain and cancellation hooks instead of the generic rejection.

Typical error strings:

- `Aborted: Timeout`
- `Aborted: Signal`
- domain errors (`Conversion error: ...`, etc.) and caught worker panic errors

### Future tasks

Error path:

1. Async body returns `Err(napi::Error)` or join failure is mapped (`... task failed: {err}`).
2. `task::future`-spawned promise rejects.
3. Shell cancellation resolves a structured result with `exitCode` omitted and `cancelled` or `timedOut` set. Running PTY cancellation also resolves flags, but may retain an observed child exit code; PTY setup cancellation rejects.

### Cancellation reporting split

- **Abort as error**: blocking exports using `heartbeat()?`.
- **Abort as typed result**: shell command APIs and the PTY running loop model cancellation in result structs; PTY pre-spawn checks remain errors.

Choose one model per API and document it explicitly.

## Common pitfalls

1. **Missing heartbeat in blocking loops**
   - Symptom: timeout/signal appears ignored until loop ends.
   - Fix: add `ct.heartbeat()?` at loop top and before expensive per-item steps.

2. **Long uncancelable sections**
   - Symptom: cancellation latency spikes during single large call (decode, sort, compression, parser invocation, etc.).
   - Fix: split work into chunks with heartbeat boundaries; if impossible, document latency.

3. **Blocking async executor**
   - Symptom: async API stalls when sync-heavy code runs directly in future.
   - Fix: move CPU/sync blocks to `task::blocking` or `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`.

4. **Inconsistent cancel semantics**
   - Symptom: one API rejects on cancel, another resolves with flags, confusing callers.
   - Fix: standardize per domain and keep docs aligned.

5. **Forgetting cancellation bridge in nested async tasks**
   - Symptom: outer token is cancelled but inner readers/subprocess tasks keep running.
   - Fix: bridge cancellation to inner token/signal and enforce grace timeout + forced abort fallback.

## Checklist for new cancellable exports

1. Classify work correctly:
   - CPU-bound or sync blocking -> `task::blocking`.
   - async I/O / `await` orchestration -> `task::future`.

2. Expose cancel inputs when needed:
   - include `timeoutMs` and `signal` in `#[napi(object)]` options,
   - create `let ct = task::CancelToken::new(timeout_ms, signal);`.

3. Wire cancellation through all layers:
   - blocking loops: `ct.heartbeat()?` at stable intervals,
   - async orchestration: race with `ct.wait()` and cancel sub-tasks/tokens.

4. Decide cancellation contract:
   - reject promise with abort error, or
   - resolve typed `{ cancelled, timedOut, ... }`,
   - keep this contract consistent for the API family.

5. Propagate failures with context:
   - map errors via `Error::from_reason(format!("...: {err}"))`,
   - include stage-specific prefixes (`spawn`, `decode`, `wait`, etc.).

6. Handle before-start and mid-flight cancellation:
   - cancellation check/await must happen before expensive body and during long execution.

7. Validate no executor misuse:
   - no long sync work directly inside async futures without `spawn_blocking`/blocking task wrapper.

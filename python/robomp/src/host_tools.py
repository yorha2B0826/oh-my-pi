    no ``node_modules``. With bun's ``hoisted`` linker the workspace links
    (``@oh-my-pi/pi-*``) only exist after an install, so without one any
    ``bun test``/``bun check`` the agent runs fails instantly with "Cannot find

    the agent starts, mirroring how the natives cache pre-populates ``.node``
    artifacts. The links resolve into *this* worktree's ``packages/*`` (not the
    orchestrator's read-only ``/work/pi``), so tests exercise the PR's edited
    source.

    ``--frozen-lockfile`` keeps the lockfile pristine (no spurious diff for the
    agent to commit) and ``--ignore-scripts`` skips lifecycle scripts so an
    untrusted PR's ``postinstall``/``prepare`` cannot execute as the slot and
    the cached native build is not redone. Runs with the same scrubbed,
    slot-owned env as the other repo-owned bun commands (``bun run fix`` /
    ``bun check``).

    Skips non-bun repos. Otherwise runs unconditionally on every launch
    (including ``--continue`` resumes): a frozen install verifies an intact
    tree in ~20ms and re-links anything missing, so a previous install that
    timed out or crashed half-way self-heals instead of being skipped forever
    on a mere ``node_modules/`` directory existing. Best-effort: any failure

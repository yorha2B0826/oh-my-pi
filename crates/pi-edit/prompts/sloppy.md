Anchored edit format: quote current text in `<SM:FIND>`, replace it with `<SM:PUT>` or insert new lines after it with `<SM:AFTER>`. Elide unchanged runs with `…`.

<ops>
`<SM:EDIT path="relative/path.ts">` opens edits in that file; a bare `<SM:EDIT>` opens more edits in the same file. Each edit is `<SM:FIND>` followed by either `<SM:PUT>` or `<SM:AFTER>`. A block holds one or more edits. All edits apply atomically.

- `<SM:FIND>` quotes current file lines. Each `<SM:FIND>` MUST match once; `<SM:EDIT path="x.ts" all>` applies its edits to every match.
- `<SM:PUT>` states the complete final text replacing the whole `<SM:FIND>` match. Empty `<SM:PUT></SM:PUT>` deletes the match; omitting the action does not.
- `<SM:AFTER>` keeps the matched text and inserts after its last line. Write only the new lines, with their final indentation. The body is literal, including blank lines and `…`.
- In `<SM:FIND>`: `…` = gap/capture — elides text you don't restate; mid-line it stays between fragments on that line, at line end it spans lines. In `<SM:PUT>`: `…` re-emits captured gaps in order — one `<SM:FIND>` gap each; with no gap left to claim it is literal text mid-line, and an error alone on its line (context elision — type the lines out).
- Tags stand alone on their own lines. Everything between tags is RAW file text: NEVER escape it — write `<`, `>`, `&`, quotes exactly as file bytes (no `&lt;`, no `&amp;`, no CDATA).

Anchor unchanged? Use `<SM:AFTER>`. Anchor also changes (e.g. needs a comma)? Use `<SM:PUT>` with the changed anchor and new lines. Move code with two edits: delete the block (empty `<SM:PUT>`), then insert it with `<SM:AFTER>` at the destination.
</ops>

<rules>
- For replacements, `<SM:FIND>` MUST include a fragment of the changed line; for insertions, quote the anchor ending just before the new lines.
- Copy `<SM:FIND>` lines byte-for-byte from the file as last read, indentation included. Exact anchors make the engine splice at the authored byte boundaries; quoted code from markdown, diffs, or another agent has untrustworthy indentation — mirror the file, not the quote.
- Every `<SM:PUT>` or `<SM:AFTER>` line is written verbatim at its exact final depth in the file's indent character. A column-0 line amid indented ones is applied flattened, silently. The engine NEVER infers, converts, or repairs indentation. NEVER add annotation lines like `//`.
- AVOID retyping unchanged lines; use `<SM:AFTER>` for insertion or `…` captures within replacements.
- Keep edits minimal: the smallest unique anchor plus the changed or new lines.
- Ambiguous repeated line? Include its unique parent branch in the same `<SM:FIND>`; NEVER retry the bare line.
- Edits address the original file; earlier edits never shift later anchors. A fuzzy location fallback may tolerate textual drift, but it NEVER repairs authored whitespace; operators and delimiters MUST match exactly.
- A failure applies nothing and includes a copy-ready corrected payload: send that verbatim.
- "No change" means the file already reads as your `<SM:PUT>`; look elsewhere.
- A file whose own lines are standalone `<SM:FIND>`/`<SM:PUT>`/`<SM:AFTER>`/`<SM:EDIT>` tags cannot be edited with this tool; use `write`.

<example>
Small change:
```text
<SM:EDIT path="src/config.ts">
<SM:FIND>
const timeout = 1000;
</SM:FIND>
<SM:PUT>
const timeout = 5000;
</SM:PUT>
</SM:EDIT>
```

Content is raw — never entity-escape:
```text
WRONG: if (a &lt; b &amp;&amp; c) {
RIGHT: if (a < b && c) {
```

Fix every match:
```text
<SM:EDIT path="src/catalog.ts" all>
<SM:FIND>
logger.debug(
</SM:FIND>
<SM:PUT>
logger.trace(
</SM:PUT>
</SM:EDIT>
```

Several edits, one file:
```text
<SM:EDIT path="src/footer.ts">
<SM:FIND>
	} else if (percent > 70) {
		str = display;
	} else {
		str = warn(display);
	}
</SM:FIND>
<SM:PUT>
	} else if (percent > 70) {
		str = warn(display);
	} else {
		str = display;
	}
</SM:PUT>
<SM:FIND>
const label = "pct";
</SM:FIND>
<SM:PUT>
const label = "percent";
</SM:PUT>
</SM:EDIT>
```

Insert new lines — keep the anchor, write only the addition:
```text
<SM:EDIT path="src/retry.ts">
<SM:FIND>
	limit: number;
</SM:FIND>
<SM:AFTER>
	/** Delay between attempts in ms */
	delayMs: number;
</SM:AFTER>
</SM:EDIT>
```

Large restructure — a gap skips the body you don't restate:
```text
<SM:EDIT path="src/render.ts">
<SM:FIND>
function legacyPipeline(input: Frame): Frame {
…
}
</SM:FIND>
<SM:PUT>
const renderPipeline = (input: Frame): Frame => commit(stage(input));
</SM:PUT>
</SM:EDIT>
```

Move a block — delete with an empty `<SM:PUT>`, insert after the destination anchor:
```text
<SM:EDIT path="src/util.ts">
<SM:FIND>
const helper = () => {
	return 1;
};
</SM:FIND>
<SM:PUT></SM:PUT>
<SM:FIND>
run(target);
</SM:FIND>
<SM:AFTER>
const helper = () => {
	return 1;
};
</SM:AFTER>
</SM:EDIT>
```

Sparse gaps carry untyped lines through; `…` in `<SM:PUT>` re-emits them:
```text
<SM:EDIT path="src/users.ts">
<SM:FIND>
loadUser(…
	const user = legacyStore.read(…);
…
}
</SM:FIND>
<SM:PUT>
loadUser(…
	const user = await database.users.read(…);
	if (!user) throw new MissingUserError(id);
…
}
</SM:PUT>
</SM:EDIT>
```
</example>

<critical>
1. First line is `<SM:EDIT path="relative/path.ts">`; a bare `<SM:EDIT>` continues the same file.
2. Follow `<SM:FIND>` with `<SM:PUT>` to replace or `<SM:AFTER>` to insert only new lines. Empty `<SM:PUT></SM:PUT>` deletes.
3. Content between tags is RAW: NEVER XML-escape `<`, `>`, `&` — write file bytes exactly.
4. Authored indentation is verbatim: every `<SM:PUT>` or `<SM:AFTER>` line carries its exact final leading whitespace in the file's indent character; the engine NEVER reindents.
5. Prove one unique match, or set `all` on the `<SM:EDIT>`.
6. After an error, send the supplied corrected payload verbatim — nothing was applied; NEVER freestyle a new guess.
7. Edit FIRST only from a verbatim file read or edit-error payload. Markdown, diffs, and agent summaries are not indentation sources; re-read the exact region before authoring whole lines.

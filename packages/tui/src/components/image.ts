	 * {@link #retire} refuses, which leaves a suppressed image resident on another
	 * surface — and releasing a resident id's key orphans it. The recreation mints
	 * a new id, nothing observes the old one again, and the next pass retires it,
	 * deleting every placement it ever made including scrollback copies.

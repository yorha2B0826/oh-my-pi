Resume prior conversation. Earlier turns archived under HISTORY below, oldest→newest. Read HISTORY fully; continue the live conversation following it.

Archived transcript scopes:
{{#if includeThinking}}- `¶user:`, `¶think:`, `¶ai:`, `¶call:`: user, assistant reasoning, assistant reply, tool call.
{{else}}- `¶user:`, `¶ai:`, `¶call:`: user, assistant reply, tool call.
{{/if}}
- Unprefixed following lines: current scope. Consecutive same-kind blocks omit repeated prefix.
- Tool call: `¶call:name(args)//intent`; trailing `//intent` optional. `<out>…</out>`: tool output.

Reading HISTORY:
- Plain text: verbatim transcript; rely on it exactly.
{{#if frameCount}}- Some middle sections: images, not text. Each image: one page of that transcript, in reading order between marked delimiters. Solid black cell: newline; runs of spaces collapse to one.
{{#if docColumns}}  - Frame: two side-by-side columns, each {{cols}} characters wide, up to {{rows}} rows tall; read left top→bottom, then right.
{{else}}  - Frame: one grid {{cols}} characters wide, up to {{rows}} rows tall; read left→right, top→bottom. No word wrap; words may break across rows.
{{/if}}{{#if sentenceInk}}  - Ink: six colors, one per sentence.
{{/if}}{{#if stopwordDimmed}}  - Function words: dim gray; content words: full ink.
{{/if}}{{#if lineRepeated}}  - Each line printed twice (white, then pale-yellow band); copies identical.
{{/if}}{{/if}}{{#if includedPreviousSummary}}- HISTORY opens with a condensed digest of still-older context predating archived turns.
{{/if}}{{#if truncatedChars}}- About {{truncatedChars}} characters of older middle history dropped to fit archive budget.
{{/if}}- If an exact earlier detail matters and a section is unclear, re-derive from workspace (re-read files, re-run commands), rather than guess.

/**
 * Decide how one advisor note reaches the primary agent.
 *
 * - A `preserveOnly` caller records every note that arrives while the primary
 *   is idle as a visible card and never starts a new primary turn.
 * - A non-interrupting `nit` always rides the non-interrupting aside queue.
 * - An interrupting `concern`/`blocker` is normally steered into the agent: into
 *   the live turn while one is streaming, or (when idle) a triggered turn so the
 *   advice is acted on immediately.
 * - If the primary tail is already a terminal text answer and there is no queued
 *   work, a late `concern` is preserved as a visible card instead of waking the
 *   primary to restate completion. A `blocker` is the exception: it means the
 *   agent handed off broken or unexercised work, so it still steers a triggered
 *   turn to force the primary to acknowledge and continue before the turn is
 *   considered done (#5628) — deferring it to the next user turn is the bug.
 * - After a deliberate user interrupt (`autoResumeSuppressed`) the advisor must
 *   not auto-resume the stopped run. While the agent is idle — or still tearing
 *   the interrupted turn down (`aborting`) — the note is preserved as a visible
 *   card instead of restarting the run. But once a turn is actively streaming
 *   again (a resume the user already drove), steering the note in does NOT
 *   auto-resume anything, so it is delivered live. Parking it during an active
 *   run instead strands it (it never reaches the running agent) and the withheld
 *   notes dump as one burst at the next user prompt — the bug this guards.
 * - During the post-interrupt immune-turn window, further `concern` notes are
 *   downgraded to asides; preservation still wins. A `blocker` is exempt: it
 *   means the agent handed off broken or unexercised work, so it still steers a
 *   triggered turn even right after a prior interrupt (#5628).

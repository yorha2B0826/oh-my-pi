/**
 * Per-session policy gate for advisor `advise()` calls.
 *
 * The advisor system prompt tells the watcher model:
 *
 * > at most one `advise` per update
 * > NEVER repeat advice you already gave, and NEVER send the same advice twice
 *
 * Real advisor models violate this. Issue #3520 captured a session where
 * `__advisor.jsonl` recorded 309 `advise` calls covering 92 unique notes —
 * 114× `Stop.`, 52× `No issue; continue.`, 41× `Done.` — flooding the primary
 * transcript with `<advisory severity="blocker">Stop.</advisory>` after the
 * task was already complete. The fix is to make the rules load-bearing in code
 * instead of prose: silently drop duplicates, content-free self-talk, and
 * over-budget calls at the `enqueueAdvice` boundary so the primary stays
 * clean even when the advisor misbehaves.
 *
 * The gate is intentionally invisible to the advisor model — `AdviseTool`
 * still returns `Recorded.` for a suppressed call. Surfacing "suppressed"
 * back into advisor context risks the model rephrasing the same useless note
 * to bypass the dedupe ("Stop.", then "Halt." then "Stop now.").
 */

 * Case-insensitive, punctuation-folded normalization. Collapses every run of
 * non-letter / non-digit characters into a single space and trims, so
 * `"Stop."`, `"*Stop*"`, and `"  stop  "` all key to `stop`, while

 * Exported for tests.

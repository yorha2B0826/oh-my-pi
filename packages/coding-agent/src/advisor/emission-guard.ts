/**
 * Per-session policy gate for advisor `advise()` calls.
 *
 * The advisor system prompt tells the watcher model a per-update advice budget
 * (default 4 non-blockers, `blocker` exempt):
 *
 * > max N non-blockers/update (`blocker` exempt)
 * > NEVER repeat advice you already gave, and NEVER send the same advice twice
 *
 * Real advisor models violate this. Issue #3520 captured a session where
 * `__advisor.jsonl` recorded 309 `advise` calls covering 92 unique notes —
 * 114× `Stop.`, 52× `No issue; continue.`, 41× `Done.` — flooding the primary
 * transcript with `<advisory severity="blocker">Stop.</advisory>` after the
 * task was already complete. The fix is to make the rules load-bearing in code
 * instead of prose: classify duplicates, content-free self-talk, and over-budget
 * calls at the emission boundary so the primary stays clean even when the advisor
 * misbehaves. `AdviseTool` reports the resulting decision; in particular, an
 * actionable over-budget note is told to retry instead of being falsely recorded.

/**
 * Reusable isolation lifecycle for subagent execution.
 *
 * Both `TaskTool` and the eval `agent()` bridge spawn subagents that can run
 * inside a copy-on-write worktree, capture their changes, and (optionally)
 * apply those changes back to the parent repo. The orchestration is identical
 * for both callers; this module hosts the shared lifecycle so eval `agent()`
 * does not need to round-trip through `TaskTool.#runSpawn`.
 *
 * Shape:
 *   1. {@link prepareIsolationContext} — resolve git root + capture baseline.
 *   2. {@link runIsolatedSubprocess}    — start worktree, run, capture
 *                                        branch/patch, tear worktree down.
 *   3. {@link mergeIsolatedChanges}     — apply captured changes back to the
 *                                        parent repo (skip when the caller
 *                                        opted out).
 *
 * Step 1 happens once per top-level call (the baseline is cloned per spawn
 * before mutation); steps 2 and 3 are per-spawn.

 * branch-merged) and the non-fatal failure handling so `TaskTool` and the
 * eval `agent()` bridge use one implementation.
 *
 * Returns a system-notification suffix to append to the parent merge summary,
 * or an empty string when nothing was applied or the nested apply succeeded.

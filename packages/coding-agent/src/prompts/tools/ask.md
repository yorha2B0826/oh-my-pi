Ask user for clarification/input during task execution.

<conditions>
- Multiple approaches with significantly different tradeoffs user should weigh.
</conditions>

<instruction>
- `recommended: <index>` marks default (0-indexed); " (Recommended)" added automatically.
- Use `questions` for related questions, not one at a time.
- Set `multi: true` on a question to allow multiple selections.
- Short option labels; explanatory tradeoffs in `description`, not labels.
- A custom input (`Other`) can be a clarifying question, not an answer (e.g. "what do you mean?", "explain X", "why?"). If so, answer it in response text first, then call `ask` again for the still-open question(s).
</instruction>

<caution>
- Provide 2-5 concise, distinct options.
</caution>

<critical>
- Default to action. Resolve ambiguity via repo conventions, existing patterns, reasonable defaults. Exhaust existing sources (code, configs, docs, history) before asking. Ask only when options have materially different tradeoffs the user must decide.
- If multiple choices acceptable: pick most conservative/standard option; proceed; state choice.
- Do NOT include "Other"; UI automatically adds "Other (type your own)" to every question.
</critical>

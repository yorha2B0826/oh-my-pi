No polling needed.

Settled-job inspection: `hub jobs` summarizes without consuming; `hub wait` delivers the selected result → no duplicate `async-result`.

Job IDs: process memory; delivered/recovered results expire shortly (~30s), unconsumed results within ~5min. Afterward use agent ID: `hub send`, `agent://<id>`, `history://<id>`.

`completed`: subagent yielded successfully; claimed artifacts unverified.

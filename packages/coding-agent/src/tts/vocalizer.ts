/**
 * Streaming assistant speech-vocalization.
 *
 * The vocalizer turns the assistant's STREAMING output into spoken audio as a
 * side effect of the normal turn. Two pipelines share the synthesis/playback
 * tail:
 *
 * - Mechanical (default): deltas run through a {@link SpeakableStream} — which
 *   drops code/tables/markup, speaks link labels and URL hosts, and cuts
 *   speakable segments the moment a boundary appears — and each ready segment
 *   is pushed to the TTS worker.
 * - Enhanced (`speech.enhanced`, requires a session-wired
 *   {@link SpeechEnhancer}): deltas accumulate into fence-aware markdown
 *   blocks; each block (small ones coalesced) is rewritten into natural spoken
 *   prose by the tiny/smol model — at most {@link MAX_REWRITES_IN_FLIGHT}
 *   completions in flight, results pushed strictly in order — then segmented
 *   by the same {@link SpeakableStream} as a safety net. A failed or timed-out
 *   rewrite falls back to mechanical cleanup of the raw block, so speech never
 *   blocks on the model.
 *
 * In both modes the synthesis session (worker, player) opens lazily on the
 * first speakable segment, and an idle timer speaks buffered text when
 * generation stalls (tool call, thinking block). One
 * {@link StreamingAudioPlayer} per utterance plays chunks back gaplessly;
 * utterance playback is chained so sequential utterances never overlap.
 *
 * Overspeech control:
 * - {@link clear} stops playback instantly (kills every live player) and
 *   aborts in-flight synthesis and rewrites — wired to a new turn, an
 *   Esc/Ctrl+C interrupt, and a sent message.
 * - {@link duck}/{@link unduck} lower/restore the volume while the user is
 *   speaking (push-to-talk), so the assistant doesn't talk over them.
 *
 * Errors are swallowed (debug-logged) so a synthesis or playback failure never
 * throws into the turn. A process-level singleton ({@link vocalizer}) is shared
 * by the event controller (streaming deltas) and the ask tool (spoken
 * questions); the event controller wires the per-session model source and
 * enhancer via {@link Vocalizer.setModelSource} and {@link Vocalizer.setEnhancer}.

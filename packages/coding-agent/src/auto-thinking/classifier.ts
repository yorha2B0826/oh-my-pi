/**
 * Per-prompt difficulty classifier for the `auto` thinking level.
 *
 * Asks one {@link ChoiceQuestion} about the user's request — or, for
 * task-spawned turns, about the delegator's `solutionSpace` description alone —
 * and maps the chosen level to a concrete {@link Effort}, clamped into the active model's
 * supported range (never below {@link Effort.Low}). The judge comes from the
 * live `judge` role chain. A local on-device candidate gets the coarser
 * `trivial|moderate|hard` question (3-class is more reliable
 * than 4-way ordinal on sub-2B models), mapped to `low|high|xhigh`.
 *
 * Throws on any failure (no judge, no key, unparseable output, abort/timeout);
 * the caller falls back to a concrete level and continues the turn.

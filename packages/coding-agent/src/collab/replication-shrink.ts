/**
 * Hard-cap helper for host→guest collab frames.
 *
 * The host wraps every {@link CollabFrame} in an AES-GCM envelope and ships it
 * through the relay's WebSocket. WebSocket servers enforce a per-frame
 * `maxPayloadLength` (Bun's default is 16 MB; many proxies cap lower). A
 * single oversized payload — typically a `read`/`bash`/`search` tool result
 * captured as one multi-megabyte string, or a tool result whose `content`
 * array holds thousands of small blocks — would otherwise ship as its own
 * oversized frame and trip that limit, killing the host's WebSocket with
 * `1006 Received too big message`. `CollabSocket` treats 1006 as transient
 * and reconnects, the next guest hello triggers the same oversized send, and
 * the loop never breaks (issue #3739).
 *
 * That ceiling has to be *enforced*, not approached (issue #11433). Three
 * input shapes escaped the previous best-effort version, each reproduced
 * before the fix:
 *
 * - a payload whose size lives in its **object keys** — a single 17 MiB key,
 *   or 200 000 short keys. Keys are identity and can never be truncated, so
 *   every string/array pass returned the payload untouched;
 * - a payload nested past the engine's own serialization limit: the walk
 *   recursed once per level and threw `RangeError: Maximum call stack size
 *   exceeded` out of the `onEntryAppended` chokepoint. Every caller swallows
 *   that throw, so the real symptom was silent: the entry never reached
 *   guests (live path), or a `snapshot-chunk` train ended without its
 *   `final: true` terminator and the guest's join timed out while the host
 *   still listed it as joined (snapshot path);
 * - a CJK-heavy payload, because the cap was compared against
 *   `JSON.stringify(...).length` — UTF-16 code units, up to 3x under the
 *   bytes the relay would see.
 *
 * The shape-preserving passes still run first: keeping the wire shape is what
 * carries discriminators and ids to the guest. What survives them is replaced
 * by a *typed placeholder*, because bounding the bytes at that point means
 * abandoning the payload by definition:
 *
 * - a session entry becomes a `custom_message` that keeps the original
 *   `id`/`parentId`/`timestamp`, so the guest's branch chain stays connected
 *   and the loss is visible in the replica instead of silent;
 * - an agent event becomes a `notice`, which by contract never enters agent
 *   state and never reaches the model.

/**
 * Pool-wide planner for spending saved OpenAI Codex rate-limit resets, plus
 * the process-wide coordinator that serializes attempts.
 *
 * A saved reset is a scarce, ~monthly credit — but it is also perishable:
 * every credit carries an `expiresAt`, and an expired credit is worth exactly
 * nothing. The planner therefore balances two failure modes instead of only
 * one: wasting a credit on a window that would have healed anyway, and letting
 * a credit die unspent. Two rules, evaluated over EVERY stored Codex account
 * (not just the session's active one):
 *
 * - `expiring-credit` (salvage; any trigger): the account's soonest available
 *   credit expires within `salvageHorizonMs` and the weekly window is at least
 *   {@link SALVAGE_MIN_USED_FRACTION} used, so redeeming restores real quota.
 *   The `keepCredits` reserve is deliberately ignored here — reserving a
 *   credit that is about to expire preserves nothing. If the window resets
 *   naturally before the credit expires, the next sweep sees a mostly-free
 *   window and skips: the credit had nothing left to restore. The backend may
 *   refuse a partial-usage consume with `nothing_to_reset`; that outcome is
 *   NON-terminal — the episode is deferred (not buried), so the credit is
 *   retried as usage grows or a window exhausts before expiry.
 * - `blocked-account` (restore; `blocked` trigger only): a live 429 blocked
 *   the turn and no sibling credential could take over, so the pool is dry.
 *   Candidates are accounts with at least one genuinely exhausted normalized
 *   chat window — 5h or weekly. A banked reset clears the account's
 *   chat rate limits generally, not just the weekly window: OpenAI's own
 *   client consumes one for a 5h-only block while the weekly window still has
 *   ~80% headroom (openai/codex#28525). The natural unblock is the LATEST
 *   reset among the exhausted windows (the account stays blocked until every
 *   one rolls over) and must be far enough away to justify the spend, with
 *   credits above the reserve. One candidate is redeemed — active account
 *   first, then the account whose credit dies soonest — and the redeem clears
 *   its credential blocks so the retry's re-rank picks it up.
 *
 * TRIGGERS: `blocked` runs from the usage-limit branch of the retry pipeline
 * after sibling switch fails, on force-refreshed reports (the cached snapshot
 * predates the 429 that got us there). `sweep` piggybacks on every successful
 * usage-report fetch — the status line polls every 5 minutes while the TUI is
 * open — so expiring credits are caught even when nothing is blocked.
 *
 * THE DECISION-2 TRAP (status MUST NOT be used to find the blocker):
 * `openai-codex.ts` applies the top-level `rate_limit.limit_reached` flag to
 * BOTH the primary (5h) and secondary (weekly) `buildUsageLimit` calls, so when
 * an account is blocked, *both* limit entries carry `status: "exhausted"`
 * regardless of which window is actually at 100%. Only `amount.usedFraction`
 * disambiguates. This module selects the base chat entries by their stable
 * limit ids, then classifies the actual window from normalized window metadata
 * before applying duration-specific policy. Whether a short wait (e.g. a
 * 5h-only block) is worth a credit is the `minBlockedMinutes` knob's call,
 * not hardcoded fiat.
 *
 * All of this is pure — no fetches, no IO. The only stateful piece is the
 * {@link CodexAutoRedeemCoordinator} container, whose read-only views are
 * passed in so the planner itself stays deterministic.

 * provider only consults the live detail endpoint when the usage payload
 * already reports a POSITIVE count — a stale ZERO is never corrected there.
 * Live data therefore replaces the report's credit block wholesale; accounts
 * with no live row (or a failed lookup) get the block stripped, so the planner
 * treats them as `credits-unknown` instead of trusting a stale count: siblings
 * stay conservative while the active account can still be synthesized from
 * live 429 evidence (the redeem re-lists atomically either way).

 *   consume so exceptions can't re-enter. Non-terminal outcomes (see
 *   {@link isTerminalRedeemOutcome}) release the key again and park the
 *   episode in `deferredUntilByKey` instead.
 * - `deferredUntilByKey`: earliest retry time for episodes whose consume was
 *   refused non-terminally (`nothing_to_reset`, transport failure).
 * - `lastAttemptAtByAccount`: per-account cooldown timestamps (epoch ms),
 *   catching attempt-key drift across a minute boundary.
 * - `inFlightByAccount`: serializes blocked passes per account — a second
 *   session for the same account adopts the in-flight promise instead of
 *   starting a second consume.
 * - `sweepInFlight` / `lastSweepAt` / `sweepPromise`: re-entrancy guard, floor,
 *   and settlement handle for the salvage sweep (a redeem refreshes usage,
 *   which would recurse into a sweep; the promise lets tests and diagnostics
 *   await a fire-and-forget sweep instead of polling).
 * - `notifiedKeys`: headless "run /usage reset" notices already emitted, so a
 *   5-minute sweep cadence can't spam the transcript.

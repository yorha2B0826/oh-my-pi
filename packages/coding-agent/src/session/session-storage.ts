/**
 * Cross-process publish serialization for the file backend. The guard-then-

 * process: without a shared lock its append can land between our freshness
 * check and our rename, and the rename then erases it.
 *
 * Exclusion comes in two layers. The outer layer is a process-owned OS gate
 * held from before the lockfile claim until after release: the kernel
 * reclaims it on process exit (including SIGKILL), so no wall-clock age
 * heuristic decides liveness and no unlink races ownership (F2). The inner
 * layer is the lockfile protocol below, kept so writers on a previous
 * binary still interoperate through the same file they always have; among
 * current writers the gate serializes the whole claim, which also closes
 * the two-reclaimer unlink race (rJDh). Against a previous-binary peer the
 * protocol degrades to its released semantics, documented on the steal
 * path. The window that remains is non-cooperating writers (plain
 * editors), against which the size check still fails closed whenever the
 * skew is detectable.
 *
 * The region is held for microseconds and never yields, so in-process
 * contention is impossible; cross-process contention fails closed after a
 * short bounded wait instead of blocking the turn loop.

/**
 * Session-file persistence of the OAuth account that served a session.
 *
 * Provider prompt caches are account-scoped (Anthropic bills a full cache
 * re-write after an account flip), and the auth store's session-sticky routing
 * is process-local when a remote auth broker is configured — the broker
 * store's KV cache is in-memory, so sticky rows die with the CLI process.
 * Resuming a session in a fresh process then re-ranks accounts by usage
 * headroom, which is biased *away* from the account that just served the
 * session (it has the highest recent burn), cold-missing the entire prefix.
 *
 * These helpers close the loop through the session file itself: after each
 * assistant turn the serving account is recorded as a `credential_pin` entry,
 * and on session adoption the pin is matched against the stored accounts and
 * seeded back into the auth store with the session's effective last-use
 * timestamp, so the provider's warm-window semantics still decide whether to
 * stick or re-rank.

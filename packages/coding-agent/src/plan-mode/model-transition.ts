/**
 * Plan-mode model transition policy.
 *
 * Plan mode drives the active session model from the `plan` role: it switches
 * to the plan model on entry and restores the pre-plan model on exit. The same
 * policy also runs when the `plan` role is reassigned mid-planning, so a
 * correction to the wrong plan model takes effect at the next turn boundary
 * (issue #5657).
 *
 * This module holds only the pure decision — what transition a given
 * (current model, resolved role, streaming) triple implies — so the branching
 * is testable without a live session or TUI. The interactive mode performs the
 * resulting side effect.

/**
 * Child-process probe for #7235: the Bash auto-background threshold race must not
 * leave a live, ref'd timer after the command finishes first. Runs the real
 * `BashTool` auto-background path for a fast command against a 30s threshold and
 * exits without disposing the job manager. A retained threshold timer would keep
 * the event loop alive until the threshold expires; the fix clears it, so the
 * process must exit promptly. The parent test measures wall-clock exit time.

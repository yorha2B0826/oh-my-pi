// (`createEditTool`, `createEditToolDefinition`, `createWriteTool`,
// `createWriteToolDefinition`) from `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, which
// aliases to this shim. The shim exported the other five tool factories
// (read/bash/grep/find/ls) but omitted edit and write, so a named import of
// either threw Bun's static "Export named X not found" error and any importing
// extension (e.g. gentle-pi) failed validation. These pin the factory surface
// and the tool definitions they build.

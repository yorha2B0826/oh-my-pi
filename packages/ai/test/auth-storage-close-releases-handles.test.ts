/**
 * Regression coverage: `SqliteAuthCredentialStore.close()` must finalize every
 * cached prepared statement before `#db.close()`.
 *
 * An unfinalized statement makes `sqlite3_close()` return SQLITE_BUSY, which
 * bun:sqlite swallows — the connection (and its `-wal`/`-shm` handles) stays
 * open. On Windows that leaves the files locked and breaks temp-dir teardown;
 * on POSIX it is silent but still leaks descriptors.
 *
 * Observable contract: after `close()`, a fresh connection can take exclusive
 * access to the file (`PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE` needs it). With a leaked
 * statement this throws "database is locked".
